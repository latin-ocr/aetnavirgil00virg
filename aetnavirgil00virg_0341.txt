COMMENTARY

a divine power was so visible in their act, that the fire
recognized it and fell back. Cf. de Mundo vi. 33 ἔνθα καὶ τὸ
τῶν Εὗσεβῶν γένος ἐξόχως ἐτίμησε τὸ δαιμόνιον, περικιιταλη-
φθέντων ὑπὸ τοῦ ῥεύματος διὰ τὸ βαστάζειν ἐπὶτῶν ὤμων γονεῖς καὶ
σώζειν.

624 Amphinomus os Relm'. Ar. is supported against Amphion
of C by Strabo 2693 Conon 433 Val. Max. v. 4, Ext. 43 Anth.
Pal. iii. 17; Claud. Carm. Min. xvii. 41. Some of the MSS.
of Valerius, indeed, give Amphz’omcs or Amphionis, but this
may easily be a corruption of Amphinomus, like the other
variants recorded Amphinomus or Amphionomus.

frater, Anapias (Strabo, Conon), Anapis (Anth. P. iii. 17),
Anaphas or Anapius (Kempf’s MSS. of val. Max. v. 4. Ext. 4).
Claudian has Anapi as vocative, which might be from either
Anapius or Anapis. Hyginus, Fab. 254, gives two quite different
names, Damon and Phintias. Solinus v. 15, p. 56 ed. Mommsen,
ed. i. says the Catinaeans called them Anapius and Amphi-
nomus; the Syracusans, Emantias and Criton ³. [See Freeman's
Appendix to vol.i of his Hist. os Sicily, which however issar
from being exhaustive] The orator Lycurgus only mentions
one, and does not give his name.

fortis, Munro and Alzinger after Rehd. If this is right it
must be added to the instances of nom. plur. in -z's. See above
on 357. Claudian similarly addresses one of the brethren as
sortis Anapi, Carm. Minor. xvii. 41.

[C has fonti5‚ which Buecheler retains, connecting it with 627
defessos posuisse in limine membra. The old couple, in order
to quench the flames, had drawn water from a spring and were
carrying it together (pari sub munere) when their strength
gave way. This does some violence to pari sub munere3 and
even if munere fontis could mean ‘fountain·duty,' i.e. duty of
bearing water from a fountain, the addition of pari more
naturally connects the words with the immediately preceding
Amphinomus fraterque than with the remoter patrem ma-
tremqua]

626 sequentem, the present editor for senemque of C. Baehrens

¹ Aelian, sr. 2 Hercher, calls them Philonomus and Callias.
