THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA’

made to recover it at Lucca, its supposed horne, were
useless. These excerpts from Aetna did not extend to all
the poem: Heinsius' expression ‘pars potissima> implies
that he did not expect to find more than a considerable
section of the poem in the lost MS. of Lucca3 and this
would agree with the fact stated above that the Gyraldinian
variants as we know them are confined to 138-285. From
the fact that the two corrections of Aetna made by Heinsius
(as above mentioned) both occur in this semion, and both
agree, the former entirely, the latter in the word cohibent,
with the completer set of variants which, since their publica-
tion by a Iena editor in 17561 and Matthiae in 1797 ²,
have been before the learned world, we may conclude that
the two Heinsian excerpts are ultimately traceable to the
same source as the completer collection published in 1756
and 1797.

That Heinsius’ excerpts went beyond the two mentioned,
is expressly stated by the elder Burmann on Ov. Met. i. 85,
where illustrating Os homini sublime dedit caelumque tueri
Iussit, he quotes Aetn. 223-226, first with the readings
uidere—posse fidem rebus—dubz'asque—Sacra perurgentem
caput atque attollere caelo, then with the emended read-
ings⁸ afterwards published as Gyraldinian, tueri—nosse
fidem reram dubias exquirere causas—Ingenium sacrare,
caputque attollere caelo 3 adding that so we must read
the passage ‘ex antiquo codico Mediceo, quem Heinsius
contulit.>
