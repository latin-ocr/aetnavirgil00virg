COMMENTARY

hae C, llaec Gyr. and L. C’s reading agrees with the omis-
sion of est (hae rerum maxima merces); but haec rerum est
optima of L and Gyr. is nearly as good, and may come from
a genuine antiquity. maxima is rather less ordinary, I think,
than optima.

274 quod of Relm‘. is preferred by Munro to quid, which
however seems defensible from the indicatives in 228, 229, and
again 238, 239, and is found in C. occulto is in L (Father
Ehrle speaks decisively against its being read occulte), is
reported independently from Gyn, and is found in Belaci. and v.
For this reason Ι admit it against exculto of CS, and so
Haupt, Munro, and Sudhaus. terrae natura of L and
Gyr. is not certain, but looks right, is Lucretian, and is pro-
nounced by Hildebrandt a real cure : I would suggest however
that natura (et) ίενναι may be latent in natura terra of C,
nature terra of v.

275 Scaliger, Munro, and most edd. make nullum opus
subject to fallere, ‘that no operation of nature should escape
us‚’ cf. on saturent 269 ; Ι prefer to give fallere an active sense
⁴ to belie,' i. e, falsify by giving an explanation which is not true.
So Ov. F. ii. 837 Brutus adest tandemque animo sua nomina
fallit belies his name of Brutus by a resolute action. It is
hard to choose between mulum to which L and Gyr. point
(mullum), and mutos (multos C), or again muto which is found
in v, and is latent in multo of Rehd. The dative would be
determined by leae rerum maxima merce&

278 Tartara mundi can hardly be an echo of Lucretius‘ sidem
mundi (ii. 328) and would require aut to be changed to acl
(so ed. Rub. 1475). It seems to be a mis-spelling either of
rumpi (L and Cyn), or perhaps offundi, ‘ is being effused.'

279 impediat . . . nutriat are correlatives and call for no
change. But illos of C is more than doubtful, as it is entirely
omitted by S(the Xlth century Stabulensian Fragment). Post-
gate‘s iras is very seductive.

280 The learned Jesuit Oudin (1715) demurred to multo
foedere, changing it to inulto or mulo, Journal de T revoux²

² Turba et disiectus has become turbae dt'sz'ectus, Lucr. iii. 928.
² The original form of the Journal des Savans.
