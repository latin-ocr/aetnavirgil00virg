There the devouring fire has halted and cheeks its
fury round the twain. Unharmed they leave the
ground at last, carrying with them their gods rescued.
For thern is the homage of bards and poesy: to
them Ditis has assigned a place apart with the
accompaniment of a glorious name. Nor deem that
any vulgar fate touches those hallowed youths: their

lot is a home beyond the reach of sorrow, with all
that the pious claim.
