AETNA

que is trajected from its proper position after eadem to the
second word.

529 propria, a property peculiar to thern, distinct from the
common nature they share with other stones: so Seneca ad
Helv. viii. 2 opposes natura communis and propria uirtus (our
individual virtue). propala of C and Relzd. is defended by
Sudh. as == πρόδηλος, a quality which is open to the senses,
and appeals to our eyes. But the word is not known to occur
elsewhere. Possibly PROPRIA became PROPALA from 1 looking
like L: we might compare delecta for deiecta in 290.

530—534 are thus written in C:

Quiinipsis quaedam siculi cognomina saxis
Inposuere fridieas etiam ipso omine significarit
Fusilis esse notas numquam tamen illa liquescunt
Quamuis materies foueat sucosior intus

Nec penitus uenae fuerint commissa molari.

530 srichas Rehd. Arzmd. 531 atque ipso nomine signant
, Relzd. : et ipso nomine signant Armzd. 532 Fusilis esse notae
Maelzly 533 succentior Relzd. Perhaps succensi0r‚ ‘ more
inflammable' 534 Ni Le Clerc commista Le Clerc.

Here the chief point of doubt is 531. Our two families of
MSS„ C on the one hand, Relm'. and the fifteenth century
codices on the other, differ signally in their tradition: Cgives
the unmetrical frz'dz'cas etiam ipso omine signficari& Rekd.
and A7‘u77d.‚sriclms atque (et Ar.) ipso nomine szgrnant.

It is not certain that nomine szssgrzant, which all editors adopt,
is right: for ipso nomine after ipsis cognomina saxis in the
preceding verse is tautologous. C's omine would have a
possible meaning ‘presage‚' the word, whatever it was, con-
veying in its sound an anticipcztz'on of the idea of ficsing.
Again with ulteriores before us in 494, we cannot at once pro-
nounce against a pentasyllable like szgrnificaril, especially with
an infin. esse following : a construction more properly belonging
to significare than to szgrnare. Georges gives only one example
of szgmzre followed by acc, and inf. (from Hist. Augusta).

But what shall we make of srz'dz'cas or srz'clzas? Scaliger
suggested (1) that it might contain the stein φρυγ-; (2) some
modification of χεῖν, perhaps clzytas: (3) of ῥεῖν, e.g. rhytas.
