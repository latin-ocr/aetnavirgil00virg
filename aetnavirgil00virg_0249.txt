COMMENTARY

cated by a small figure which carne out at the bottom and
pointed with a wand to the hour. This figure might be the
dux of 29'2, if we suppose a Triton trumpeting to this in-
dicator simultaneously with the egress of the figure as the hour
arrived.

[My own suggestion urna ciens Tritona canorum is based on
sonatum dius tritona canoro of Vat. 3272. The accus. tritona
is also in Reltd. and Arund. The hydraulic machine described
by our poet might, 1 think, be called urna, a word of wide
extension, and not inapplicable to a contrivance in which water
played a leading part. And such a vessel, as containing the
machinery which made the Triton sound‚ might be said to set
the Triton in motion (ciens Tritona) 1.]

196 the description passes from the main point of the corn—
parison to collateral details. Pellit does not introduce an
apodosis, but the description proceeds independently. opus,
the machinery, or more exactly, the action of the different forces
combined to produce the trumpeting. [moueri for mouere seems
to me almost necessary, as it is the action of the water on the air
which is emphasized. Publil. Optatianus‚ however, in his hexa—
meter description of a water-organ (20) says, unda latens prope-
rantibus incita uentis, which would correspond to uictus mouere
spiritur] collectus aquae, ‘a body of water,’ is Lucretiam,

not imply any large amount of water.
