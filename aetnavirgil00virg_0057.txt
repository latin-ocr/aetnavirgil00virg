THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA’

NOT the least of the services which the great scholar
H. A. J. Munro has rendered to Latin Philology, is the
collation he made in 1866-7 of the unique Cambridge MS.
(C) of Aetna. Its existence, indeed, had not escaped at
least one scholar of his University long before ‚- for as far
back as March of 1703, John Dav-ies, the editor of Cicero’s
de Diuinatione and de Natura Deorum, transcribed¹ from
it vv. 559-644 (Armatus flamma est. lzis uiribus additur
ingens. . . . Sed curae cessere domus et iura piorum), and on
jissy 23, 1710²,sent a copy ufffich he had rnade ofthe
entire MS. (then in the library of Bp. Moore at Ely) to
Le Clerc, who was preparing a second edition of his com-
mentary on the poem. Towards the middle or end of the
eighteenth century the MS. was known to Wassenberg ³.
But as late as 1826 it was still lying perdu and unrecognized,
for Jacob makes no mention of it in his edition of that
year. Even after special attention had been called to it
in 1842 by Ritschl (Rheim'sclzes Affasenm, p. 135), Haupt⁴
in 1854‚though wess hnbnned of ᾖε anfiqusty Gt was

² Hoeven, de Ioanne Clerico disset—tamnes duae (1842), p. 155. Le
Clerc published‚ under the pseudonym of Coranus, a first edition of
Aetna in 1703, a second in 1715. He seems to have made no use os
Davies' collation os C.
