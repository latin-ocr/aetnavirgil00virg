PREFACE

Gyr.=the readings of a very early MS. now lost, but used in
the sixteenth century by Lilius GyraIdus, who transcribed from
it a poem, ‘ de Aetna montel From this codex, which Gyraldus
says contained Claudian, are believed to spring certain variants
on Aetna (only on 138—285) not traceable in any complete
codex of the poem3 on which see Prolegom.‚ pp. lxiv-Jxxxiv.
One fragment alone, the last sixteen of these verses (270-285),
is preserved entire with the Gyraldinian variants as we know
thern from the two collations made of them in the eighteenth
century. This fragment of sixteen entire verses (L) is extant in
a MS. os the Laurentian Library at Florence (33. 9), and by the
kindness of Father Ehrle, S.J., Librarian of the Vatican, who
copied them himself from the MS„ Ι arn able to present thern
to my readers exactly as there written. The value of these
variants is a point on which critics are not agreed: my own
judgement is decidedly against allowing them a preponderating
authority against our two early sources C S.

To the above must be added another set of variants contained
in MS. D'Orville x. 1, 6, 6, of the eighteenth century, in the
Bodleian. This codex contains, as stated on p. 1, ‘notes and
emendations' by Pierre Pithou on the text of his well-known
Engrammata et Poematia Vetera, Paris, 1590. Those on
Aetna begin on p. 40 of the MS. I communicated these to the
Classical Review for March, 1900, whence they are reprinted,
Prolegom.‚ p. lxxxiV. I call thern Excerpta pithoeana.

Other MSS. I have looked at, but not judged them worth
collating in extenso. Such are Sloane 777 in the British
Museum 3 Corsini43 F. ΙΙΙ. 21 ; Naples Museum 207 ; another
in the Chigi Library at Rome3 Helmstadz'ensz's 332 now at
W'olfenbiittel. But we must deeply lament the loss of Aetna
in Corsini 43 F. 5, the same MS. which alone has preserved
the right reading of Cul. 366, and of whose readings in the
pseud-Ovidian Epistula Sapphus I have published a collation
in the Classical Rewew for June 1901. The scribe of this
MS. began copying Aetna, but lest off at v. 7. It alone has
preserved in v. 1 the variant ruptisque caui.
