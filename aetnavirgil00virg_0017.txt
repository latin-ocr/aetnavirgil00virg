PREFACE

The fragmentum Stabulense was first publisbed in 1854 by
Bormans in the Belgian Bulletz'ns de [Ἀ cad. Royale des Sciences
et Belles Lettres, Tome xxi. Munro did not include it in his
edition: but it was re—collated by Bahrens in 1875, and Ι have
myself examined it several times.

S agrees very closely with C, and its imperfect state (it is
often illegible) is much to be deplored. See my notes of a re-
collation of S in sourn. osPlzilol. sor 1895, pp. 1—9.

Rehd. or r= MS. Rehdiger 125 in the Town Library of Breslau,
of the fifteenth century. Ι collated it at Breslau in 1891, and
published my collation in Journ. of Plzilol. for 1892, vol. xx.
pp. 207—223. Its readings had been exhibited before by Jacob
in 1826, and partially by Munro in 1867. He calls it ε.

The same library contains another MS. of Aetna, Rehd. 60.
1 looked into this only cursorily: one of its variants however,
” plebeis in 600, suggests a new emendation, which Ι think may be
right.

Arund. or Ar.=Arunde1 133, in the British Museum, in
double columns, of the fifteenth century. It contains also the
Ciris and Catalepta. Munro used it and called it γ.

Both Relid. and A rand. are good enough to be quoted, hardly
to be quoted entire. At times both are hopelessly corrupted,
and the true reading exists in C or S only. A typical specimen
is 209.

v= Vatican 3272 of the fifteenth century, containing Aetn.

1—432 fecundius aethna. Interpolated‚ but at times with readings
which differ from Rehd. or Ar„ and may go back to an early

source. Collated by me in the Vatican Library, April and
May, 1887.

Esc.=Q. 1. 14, in the Library of the Escorial near
Madrid. This is a large volume of excerpts from a great
number of Roman authors, prose and poetry alike. Hartel
in his Bibliotheca Patrum Hispaniensis dates the MS. as of
cent. xiii-xiv. I copied the excerpts from Culex and Aetna and
published them in 1894, 5 (Journ. of Plzz'lol. xxii. pp. 314—
316, xxiii. 1—4). They agree closely with those os Bahrens'
Paris MSS. 7647 and 17903‚ which are not included in my
App. C rit. '
