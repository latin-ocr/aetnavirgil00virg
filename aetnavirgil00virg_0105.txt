ANALYSIS 01⁴* THE POEM

' (Stramboli) possesses not only sulphur and bitumen, but a stone
which is inflammable, yet its conflagrations are short-lived. The
island Hiera( Vulcano) has similarly cooled, and become a harbour
where ships lie at anchor3 only a small portion of it is still
volcanic ; but this is in no way comparable with Aetna. Indeed
it would long ago have become extinct entirely, were it not
secretly supplied from Aetna by a submarine channel.
(447-508) Facts of sight, however, are the best attestation.
Round the sides of Aetna you may see stones in a state of fuming
beat, and rocks with the fire smouldering in their pores. This
is owing to their contact with the burning molaris, which gathers
up the leavings of other fires and spreads its own flame to them.
This is outsid03 ‘m'fht'n the volcano the molaris is even more
potent in its solicitations (to burn). When it begins to prepare
for an eruption, there are premonitory signs, such as cracking
of the ground, falling away of the soil, low murmurs from the
depths of the mountain, flame. When these occur it is time to
withdraw to the safety of some adjoining eminence. The erup-
tion comes in a moment, masses of burning rock are heaved
into the air, shoals of black sand are driven up to the stars·
They fall into the most fantastic shapes. Some look like troops
under defeat, some are still maintaining a sturdy resistance to
the flames: in one part the fiery foe is putting forth its whole
strength and seems to pant with the effort, elsewhere it is dying
gradually down. The stones thrown out have a different look.
Some have a dirty and rugged-seeming surface, like the scoria
from smelted iron. Others that have fallen pyramidally upon
each other burn away as if in an actual furnace. Gradually the
inner substance of the stone liquefies‚ assumes a more intense
glow, and at last becomes a fiery flood which pours down the
slopes of the mountain, sometimes advancing to a distance of
twelve Roman miles. Obstacles that cross its path are ineffec-
tual to stay its course—trees, rocks, earth float side by side with
each other—or are consumed and absorbed by the all-assimilat-
ing lava-flood. Sometimes the unevenness of the ground brings
the flood to a halt3 then the waves crowd up, rising one above
the other with a Ioud sound‚ looking like a sea in agitation‚
when billow follows billow, those in front small, those farther out
