THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

Aetna was written late. Suetonius mentions the emperor
Claudius¹ as employing the Triton in a spectacular nau-
machia exhibited on lake Fucinus ², Nero as spending the
greater part of a day in examining and exhibiting hydraulic
organs of a new make, engaging to bring them before the
notice of the public, and promising himself to play one
in the theatre (Ner. 41, 54).

The fact of these two mechanical contrivances being
combined in the poem certainly points to both being
familiarly known at the time 3 nor is the force of Werns-
dorf's reasoning much weakened by the circumstance that
several centuries before the mathematician Heron³ had
described successively both the trumpeting Triton and the
water-organ. And if Cicero ⁴ tells us that the water-organ
was sometimes listened to in the last years of his life (Tusc.
Disp. iii. 18), this goes for little against the coincident
testimony of Seneca and Suetonius as to its being a
prevailc'ng fasla'on of the Claudian and Neronian era
(Sen. Ep. 84. 10, 87. 12, 13).

Ι must not omit a special episode of Aetna which is
common to the poet and Seneca, the story of the Catinaean
brothers, whose piety saved their parents from perishing
by the fires of the volcano. Seneca twice mentions this tale,
both times in the De Beneficiis ii. 37 Vicere Siculi iuuenes
cum Aetna maiore ui peragitata in urbes, in agros, in

¹ Claud. 21.

² The words of Suetonius (Claud. 21) emissurus Fucinmn lacum
¹ naumachiam ante commisit most naturally refer to the time when
the artificial channel of the emissarium was completed‚ but not yet
in action. The charmel took eleven years to construet (Suet. Claud.
20) ε the naumachia would thus fall in 52 Α. 1). only two years before
the accession of Nero. Cf. Smilda on Suet. Claui. 21.
