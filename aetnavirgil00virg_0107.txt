ANALYSIS OF THE POEM

Amphion's lyre, her legends of the seven chiess‚ of Amphiaraus
gulfed in the abyss3 of Eteocles and Polynices, whose mutual
hatred continued after death, surviving in the divided fumes os
their common altar: Sparta, with its sacred band of 300, the
heroes of Thermopylae: Athens, sung by innumerable poets,
and recalling at every step a legend: Troy and Hector; the
tombs os Hector, Achilles, Paris. We stand entranced before
Apelles’ Venus, Timomachus' Medea, Timanthes’ Iphigenia,
Myron's Heifer. Yet none of these merely human sights can
rival the stupendous manifestations of the supreme artificer
Nature, nowhere more wonderful in her workings than here, if
only they are observed at the right time. .

(602—fin.) And yet Aetna, criminal as she may be, has a pious
memory of her own. Once upon a time the volcano kindled into
flame and spread destruction over the surrounding country. So
swift was its advance, that the Catinaeans had hardly begun to
know the fire was on its way when it had already reached their
walls. Snatching up each what they thought most precious—
money, gold vessels, armour, poenis—they fled for life : in vain,
the flames surrounded and consumed them. Two only, Amphi-
nomus and his brother, seeing their parents too infirm to escape,
lifted them on their shoulders, and with this pious burden con-
fronted the flames. O power of piety unsurpassable! The fire
gave way on either side and would not assail them : they escaped
with the burden which to them was more than all treasures, their
father and mother. For this they are rewarded with eternal
remembrance in poetry‚ and a special mansion in Elysium.
