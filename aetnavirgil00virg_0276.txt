AETN A

superant quaecumque = quaecumque superant3 superant,
‘ abound‚’ the whole store of Aetna’s vast supply os combustibles,
a common meaning3 e. g. G. ii. 331 superat tener omnibus
umor.

rzjgent seems the right word: it¹ gives the idea of profuse
pouring; a rain of fire. Munro on Lucr. ii. 262 molus per
membra rzganlur, iv. 907 somnus per membra quietem lrrzget
shows that rzjgare is sometimes constructed with an accus, of
the thing poured or shed. He quotes Furius in Macrob. vi.
Ι. 44 mz'lemque ngat per pectora somnum.

siluae is explained by Munro ‘ materials’=23'>u7 of Strab. 274
ἐπιλειπούσης τῆς ὕλης, Philostr. Imagin. 365 (p. 95, Benndorf)
τὰ τὴν ὕλην ἐξερεθίζοντα, both of Aetna3 but he acknowledges
the plural1 to be curious. In the passage, cited by Alzinger
from Lucretius i. 902, 903 Verum semina sunt ardoris multa,
terendo Quae cum confluxere, creant incendia siluis, the mean-
ing is ‘sorests,‘ and the resemblance of the verse of Aetna is
so decided as to make it more than probable that this is the
meaning there also. Strabo mentions the oak-woods of Aetna,
273 τὰ κάτω δὲ δρυμοῖς καὶ φυτείαις διείληπται παντοδαπαῖς. In
modern times the chworoszz or woody zone (Swinburne, Travels
in Sicily, ii. p. 3703 Daubeny, Descrz'plion os Volcanos, p. 271)
is the second and middlemost of the three belts into which
Etna is divided. Swinburne„who visited Sicily in 1777—1780‚
describes these woods as very beautiful, with risings and falls
like an English park. On p. 373 he says, sp'eaking os the
south-east, ‘ Near the entrance of the wood, chestnut and oak
trees are intermixed‚ afterwards oak alone is to be seen3 some
of them of a prodigious size3 the largest Ι measured was
twenty-eight feet in circumference. As we approached the
inner verge of the woody region, the oaks diminished in bulk
and number, and were succeeded by the taeda pine‚ but Ι saw
none among these of any large dimensions.' It is possible that
these turpentiniserous pines may be in the poet’s thoughts;
perhaps also the attrition of the boughs in the oak or chestnut

¹ Waglcr, p. 59, takes siluae as gen. singular depending on
incendia. This I think is wrong.
