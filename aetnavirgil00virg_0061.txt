THE‘ MSS. OF ‘AETNA’

srom all the fifteenth-eentury copies. The Gyraldinian
readings may here be passed by, as they extend to only
a small section of the poem (138—285) 3 and their genuine-
ness, regarded as a whole, is not quite beyond suspicion.

(a) The following verse of Aetna is preserved in CS ¹
alone :—

61 In commune uenit iam patri dextera Pallas
In C alone :-

468,469 Illinc incertae facies hominumque figurae
Pars lapidum domita stanti pars robora pugnae

The following half-lines are found in CS, not in the fifteenth-
century MSS. :—

53 —que tertia sidera signis
326 siponibus actus (only sipon- remains in S)
444 Siculi uicinia montis (in Catone, S being lost here)

(b) The following verses are intelligible in CS, unintelligible
in fifteenth-century MSS. :—

95 extremique maris curuis incingitur undis CS
Rehd. and v curuis hic agitur (agitabitur v)
105 Sed tortis² rimosa cauis CS
totis ¹ xvth cent. MSS.
121 errantes arcessant undique uenas C
et undas Reled. ab undis v

192‚3 custodiaque ignis Illi operum est arcent aditus C

opertum est arcent dictis Rehd.

² Wagler shows, p. 5, that the variations of S from Care chiefly
wrong divisions os words, e. g. Ossa noljwnpns,flammare mouet; but
the advantage is sometimes on the side of S, e.g. inclusi solislum,
inserte, for inclusis olidum, infir! e os C. I cannot agree with Wagler
in his judgment that Sis ‘proprio pretio plane destitutum ²: its slight
variations are of great value where the critical question comes into
view.

² 5 has tontis, but the ι’ is scarcely perceptible.
