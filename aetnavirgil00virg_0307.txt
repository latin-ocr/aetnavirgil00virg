COMMENTARY

sc. ignibus, abl. absol., ‘supposing the fires to have joined!
fixo (amni) uix quisquam dimouerit illas (ripas), ‘ will scarcely
part those banks away to free (the course of) the now fixed river,'
i.e. will part the lava-masses and make a free passage for the
temporarily-arrested water. He here follows mainly Buecheler.

Buecheler, however (Rlz. illus. liv. p. 5), differs from Sudh. in
explaining ut in close relation to Incolumi struere cadunt, ‘ but
they fall with such an impetus as at some former time to have
carried the fire across the Symaethus: at that time it must
have been a difficult task to recover the course of the stream:
and in our time it takes often many days to move the lava-
masses out of the way.’ The position of ut not at the beginning
of its clause, but removed from it by three preceding words,
would be very Ciceronian, e. g. Sest. xliii. 93 uillam accit-'ficare
tantam, tugurium ut iam uideatur esse illa uilla quam . . . olim
in contionibus explicabat.

The main points of doubt are (A) the meaning of ut quondam,
(Β) offixo.

A. (1) ut quondam in Vergil=‘as at some time,' G. iii. 99,
iv. 261. This cannot be the meaning here: nor, ‘as once‚'

n. v. 88.
ΑΕ(2) ᾳῑιςοηῑῐαυι in all the other four Aetna instances quoted in

Wagler’s Index = formerly.

(3) The combination ut ᾳιιοηιίαυιεί when at some time‚' is so
rare as to be almost unexampled.

(4) uerum (505) has a special attraction to ut= quamuis,
‘however‚ allowing that? Drager, Hz'st. Synt. ii. p. 730, quotes
two cases. Cic. pro Tull. 54 uerum ut esses dum‘ssimus, and
56 uerum ut lzoc tibi credam. This makes slightly against
Buecheler's view.

B. The easiest view offixo is to consider it a participial sub-
stantive: hausti, Aetn. 407, exhausti, Geor. ii. 398, which Servius
explains as exhaustionis: thus fixum=‘a state of fixity) So
solitum, debitum, constitutum, exspectatum, &c.; cf. corruptum
(Cels. v. 28. 13).

The choice seems, therefore, to lie between Buecheler’s view
and my own. Isthe former is right, and ut = ‘so that,’ Baehrens*
ingens sor ignes would make the meaning clearer, and take from
