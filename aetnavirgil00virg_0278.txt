nowhere in such abundance as to be worked. The great
sulphur districts of Sicily are entirely detached from its vol-
canic system, and the mineral appears to have originated from
the decomposition of beds of gypsum.’

389 alumine for numine of C, uimine of v, was not dis-
covered till Jacob's edition (1826). It is undoubtedly right.
Sudhaus shows that sulphur, alumen, bitumen are quoted three
times in this order by VitruV. viii. 2, 33 Pliny in his descrip-
tion, H. N. xxxv, 174—183, gives the sequence—sulphur, bitumen,
alumen. Pliny uses the adj. spissum twice of alum: 184, where
he distinguishes two sorts‚ the liquid and the spiss3 188 where,
describing the alum of Melos, which he considers the best, he
says nullum spissius.

comminus is explained by Sudh. ‘in close vicinity‚’ near
enough to attract flarne, such as naphtha, of which Pliny says,
ii. 23 5 Huic magna cognatio zgrnz'mn, transsz'lz'zcnlque in eam
protinus undecunque uisam: and so Posidonius ap. Strab. 743
speaks of naphtha springs attracting (ἐπισπὼσας) fire. 1t is
possible, however, that comminus irritat = ‘rouses to a hand
and hand encounter’ of forces; with this acris would well
agree, suggesting the determination of the fire to press the
advantage it has over an unequal‚ though resisting, soe. Cf.
rudibus contendere massis, 561, of the struggle which mechanics,
aided by wind and fire, carry on with the masses of metal
which they are fusing.

A very doubtful passage. All edd.‚ except Sudhaus, demur
to eripiantur. Haupt's eripient = extorquebunt, ‘ will force you
to believe,‘ gives to eripere a sense not proven: in Tib. i. 9. 35
