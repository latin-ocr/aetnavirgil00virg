fraterno ueniet concordia sumo, Quam uetus accensa separat
ira pyra. Much later Pausanias (ix. 18. 3) says he believed
this miracle‚ though he had never witnessed it himself: it was
as famous in antiquity as the yearly liquefaction of S. Januarius'
blood at N aples in modern times ¹.

579 sua turba recenti of C was corrected by Scaliger to sua
turba regenti, and explained by Le Clerc of the Spartan ἐνωμοτία,
which Hesych. describes as τάξις τις διὰ σφαγίων ἐνώμοτος. Grote,
Hist. Greece, ii. p. 615: ‘It was a small company of rnen, the
number of whom was variable‚ being given differently at twenty-
five, thirty-two, or thirty-six men—drilled and practised together
in military evolutions‚ and bound to each other by a common
oath. Each Enomoty had a separate captain or enomotarch,
the strongest and ablest soldier of the company, who always

geminum sumum edentia ex uno uapore (i. e. ardore, a far from un—
common use of the word). Gemina fumantia is in fact a persectly
legitimate expression for what is “ divided in smoking'’ or “ when it

minacem? Postgate, CI. Rev. xiv. 421.]
