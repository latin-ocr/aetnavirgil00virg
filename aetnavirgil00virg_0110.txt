AETNA

AETNA—the fires that burst frorn its deep furnaces
—what are those strong forces that roll on its volumes
of fiame, what it is that chafes at being ruled, what
whirls aloft its dinning eurrents—shall be my song.
Corne thou to favour and support me as I sing,
whether Cynthos hold thee, or Hyla be more accept-
able than Delos, or Ladon's daughter (Daphne) be
more precious in thy sight 3 and'with thee may the
Sister Muses hasten from the Pierian spring to coun-
tenance my new aspiration 3 the track which traverses
strange ground is safer when Phoebus leads the way.

Who but has heard of the Golden Age of the
king that knew not care? when no one ploughed
the fields to throw in the grain, or kept noisome
weeds from the crops that were to come, but over-
fiowing harvests filled the barns for every year,
Bacchus ran into wine by no foot hut his own,
honies distilled from the clammy leaves, Pallas set
flowing her own separate streams of rich olive-oil.

Then was the true graeiousness os the country;
