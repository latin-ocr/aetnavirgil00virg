(the waves) on, small in size and curving them flatly: such as
are farther on [larger and with more of a billowy look.’]
With· simas (ἲ cymas), ‘and first traces (agit) only slight undu-
latiens!

[Birt, thsslol 1898, p. 636, retains zmas of MSS.

Ac primurn tenuis, imas agit ulteriores,

‘and first pushes on waves of small size, afterwards, when they
have plunged into a valleyl (meas), spreads them further out‚'
and so Hildebrandt, Beitrage, p. 24. But (Ι) could imas possibly
mean this? (2) ulteriores is palpably opposed, not to tenui-v, but
to primum, as M unro saw.

The diffi‘culty of imas is not solved by so violent an interpreta-
tion. It is safer to accept the milder alternative of supposing
that s of simas has fallen out after lenuis, the more so that this
is actually found in the Helmstadt MS.]

495 succernens was first translated by Munro ‘ sifting out,’ i.e.
the stones not yet molten and other substances. And so Birt,
p. 636. After this verse there is obviously another lacuna.

496 ripis was explained by Le Clerc and &Vemsdorf of river-
banks, on reaching which the lava (flumina) hal-ts: and cer-
tainly in 506 he seems to speak of its crossing the Symaethus as
exceptional. It is far more probable that flumina and ripis are
correlatives, and flumina being the lava-stream, ripis must
be the outer or bounding edges of the stream on either side,
which as the lava comes to a stand-still, are arrested with it.

durant, neuter, as probably in Verg. Ecl. vi. 35.

497 messis, a natural comparison, ‘waving field of flame‚'
moulded on Vergil's seges horret Ferrea (Aen. xii. 663), a field
of bristling sword-points ε atraque late Horrescit strictis seges
ensibus (Aen. vii. 525).

499 Efficmat, ‘ discharges a sume ’ τ ἅπ. λεγ.

501 &fiexa of MSS. is perhaps inflixa, an occasional form
of the participle of inflzgro. Goetz, Thesczzcr. Glassar. Emendat.
p. 573 inflixa ἐνθλιβεῖσα. So Scaliger.

pulsatos is referred by Sudhaus to the ἀντιτυπία produced by
each impact, ‘blows and counter-blows.’ Plut. M. 929 δεῖ τὸ
