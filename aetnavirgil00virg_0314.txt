AETNA

Against this may be urged :

1. διφρυγές suggestS‚ not melting or fusing, but roasting. The
poet says the name intimated susz'bilily, and gives no hint of
a double action of fire.

2. N either Pliny nor Dioscorides connect the diphryges with
Sicily3 both with Cyprus: a particular Cyprian clay was first
dried in the sun, then burnt in a wood fire, whence the name.

3. The pyrites ¹, which when burnt in an oven, donec excoqua-
tur in rubricam, became one kind of ‘ twice-baked’ (διφρυγές),
Pliny’s first, Dioscorides' third species, does not seem to have ’
been the molaris 01· lava-stone, as Birt supposes, though this
was sometimes called pyrites. Pliny would have been careful
to prevent confusion on this point: and the black colour of
lava is against it. Nor, indeed, does the poet of Aetna say
that lava had a name in Sicily which implied its fusibility:
he says ipsis saxis, having just before mentioned that par-
ticular kinds of stones had the property of buming, and that
these were distinct from the molaris.

4. dt'plzryx, which Birt infers from diphryga, is not known
to occur.

Kaibel’s rlzyacas (ῥύακας) can hardly be right, as ῥύαξ is
recurrently the lava—flood, not the name of a stone.

Rejecting fridicas, we may perhaps elicit from fricluzs, the
shorter and seemingly more original form,
(1) Imposuere Ὲρύδας et iam omine significarunt ·
or (2) Imposuere Έρὺδας et iam ipso nomine signant.
(1) is assailable palaeographically, because szjgm'ficarit (C ) looks
like a rnere miswriting of szjgm'ficant, and this might originally
have been an explanation ot' szjgnant: again C equally with
Relzd. and Arund. has ipso, and this part of the tradition,
though tautologous, seems reliable; is it is, nomine is almost
certainly right, not omine: again, as diction, omine would be
a little unusual. Ovid is specially fond of the combination
segnare (-νι’) nomine: F. ii. 862 szjgnatus nomine mensis; M. viii.

¹ From Dioscorides v. 142 it might seem that the pyrites osv. 119
(λίθον τὸν λεγόμενον πυρίτην συνθέντες εἷς κάμινον . . . καίουσιν) is the
stone there described.
