AETNA

I have followed a suggestion of Rehd. and suppose that

Han
quamuis tanta is a corruption of uz’s qtantcz. Claudian Rapt.

Pros. i. 170 quae tanta cauernas Vis glomeret. Markland’s
inmensum for in densum would be unusual: preferable is
Schmid's z'n denso, forming an effective antithesis to Explicel;
the fires inside Aetna are pent in a close body, which requires
an unusual force to liberate and expand them.

28 Ignibus z'rrzguis‚ ‘ces flots de lave brfilante ' Chenu.

36 facies lmec altera uatum. Two classes of poets seem to
be meant, those who ascribe the marvels of nature to a divine
power working in thern, those who turn such marvels into
mythological legends (Scaliger).

llaec altera. Flor. iii. 1. 9 llaec altera contra regem causa belli
ficit.

38 Henry, Aeneidea‚ vol. iii. p. 724 (on Aen. viii. 753 IN
NVMERVM)‚ explains numerosa of the measured or rhythmical
time of the strokes‚ one party striking all at once, and another
party all at once, and alternately with the former.

51-53 Impius et miles metuentia corninus astra

Prouocat infestus cunctos ad proelia diuos
Prouocat admotisque tertia sidera signis. CS.

Eormans ¹ suggested admotis qua tertia sidera agnis, explain-
ing of the third class of stars occupying the highest empyrean,
as Manil. v fin. speaks of orders of stars‚ Sunt stellae procerum
similes sunl proxima primis Sidera, suntque gradus alque
omnia ficta priorum. See my Noct. Manil. p. 210. Without
such specializing of the sense of tertia, the poet of Aetna
might simply mean that the giants carried the attack to the
extremest part of the sky, where the hindmost stars were
ranged.

The passage is at best strangely tautologous. What can be
weaker than the twice repeated prouocat? But we need not,
in cumulum κακοτεχνίας, add another repetition ατί territa
(Wassenberg and Haupt) or trementia (Munro), when, as
Baehrens well says, ‘talis notio post metuentia astra plane

¹ Bormans also conj. admotisque trementia (so after him Munro), but
rejected it in favour of the other conj.
