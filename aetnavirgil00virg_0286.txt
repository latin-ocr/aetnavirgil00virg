AETNA

Epomeo’s 1 sudden outbreaks: cum repente flamma ex eo emi-
auisset : and such is the character of Ischian outbreaks of
nature to this day, as the earthquakes of 1881, 1883 prove.

Hildebrandt defends flagrans (fuisse) by similar passages in
Pliny, H. N. viii. 154 Idem (Bucephalas) in proeliis memoratae
cuiusdam perhibetur operae (fuisse). xxxvi. 94 legitur et pensi·
lis hortus (fuisse): owing to the doubtfulness of 429 the point
cannot be settled, but an infin. certainly would be more natural.

429 Nunc extincta super² ought to mean ‘at the present
time quenched at the top,' i. e. with its crater no longer dis-
charging flame, but covered over with grass and trees. testisque
would then mean that an attestation of Aenaria having once been
volcanic, though in the poet’s time the fire was extinct‚ was to
be found in a similar region between Cumae and Naples, which
had once been volcanic and was then so no longer.

But the ν. 1. recorded by Pithou in MS. D‘Orv. 195 seems to
show that the tradition of 429 was in some way confused, (1) in
superest being written in the margin of 428, indicating that besides
super lestis there was a ν. l. superest 3 (2) in the separation of
exlin· from -cta‚ and the hesitation of the copyist between super
testisque and testis superque. This appears to me to support
a conj. which I made many years ag0, and have lately printed
in Postgate’s Corpus Poet. Lat. vol. ii, p. 73 Nunc extincta [diu]
superestque Neapolin inter. super est written thus, as the word
would be in early MSS. (not superest), would account for the
change to super testis, and the diu would fall out as hyper-

¹ Epomco, the Roman Epopeus, is the chief mountain os Isehia
(ernaria‘). It has long been extinct; the great eruption of 1302 A. D.
left its record in the 12} miles of lava blocks in the neighbourhood of
the town os Isehia. Julius Obsequens de Prodigiis 114 states that at the
time of the outbreak of the Social War (Rc. 91) Aenariae terrae ltiatu
flamma exorta in caelum emicuit. This must have been more than
100 years before our poet, and we may perhaps conclude that it was
only a minor outbreak, which occasioned no permanent impression.

² Buecheler (Rh. Mus. liv. p. 5) joins super msicliis, adding ‘uidetur
poeta tangere sub Epopeo strata Typhonis cubilia ’ (Strab. 248).
This seems artificial. Munro's super testisque, ‘ and there is a witness
besides,' is objectionable from the position of quc.
