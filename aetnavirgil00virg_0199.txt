COMMENTARY

Ther. 150 λιθάδας τε καὶ ἕρμακας ἐνναίοντες ¹. But this word
can hardly be charibdis (1) because this, as common and

recurrent, could never have been corrupted into corinevs,
lt lz
cormeos3 (2) S gives it quite differently as carinis or carlms,

v as carambos; (3) charybdis (as Sudhaus observes) is not
well applicable to a heap of stones with interstices which
make it hollow: it could only be as representing successive
layers os water suspended one over another that it would resemble
such heaps. Gronovius (Obss. iii. 6) suggested corymbas in the
passage of Aetna ; this or possibly corymbis (a feminine how-
ever not known to exist) might well express a heap of stones
rising to a head or point ε cf. Homer‘s ι’ίκριι κόρυμβα--ἀκροστόλιυ,
and Hesych. κόρυμβον τὴν ἀκρόπολιν, ἐπειδὴ ἐφ’ ὕψος ἐστι’. τὴν
ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς τοῦ ὅρους ὕλην. καὶ καθόλου πάντα τὰ μετέωρα καὶ
εἷς ὕψος ἀνατείνοντα κορύμβους λέγουσιν. The Vatican MS.
of Aetna gives carambos, which is not far from corymbas or
corymbis, and this again is nearer to corz‘neos or cormeos of
the Placidus glosses ².

In 108 the termination -ae officlurae points to a genitive
simili(s) figurae: so in 14 I alter pingui to pinguis, which is
similarly pointed to by oliuae.

Effugiens molitus inter seu nympha perenni
Edit humum limo furtimque obstantia mollit
Aut etiam inclusis olidum uidere uapores. C.

² The words os Dauberw, speaking of the Solsatara (Descriptz'on
of Volcanos, p. 213} are almost a paraphrase of the above passage:
‘ The Solfatara returns a hollow sound when any part of its surface is
struck, and hence has been conjectured to be made up, not of one
entire rock, but osa number of detached blocks, which, hanging as it
were by each other, form a sort of vault over the abyss, within which
the volcanic operations are going on.’
