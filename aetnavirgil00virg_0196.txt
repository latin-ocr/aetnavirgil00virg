AETNA

defit is, as diction, not very good. 1 suspect a deeper vitiation.
desunt is perhaps the conflation of two originally distinct words
est ducit : in the archetype ducit had become dunt. (Cf. lances

C
sor latices Manil. ii. 9, where the Matritensis gives latites.)
The original v. would thus be

Non totum ex solido est: ducit namque omnis hiatum,
Secta est omnis humus.

hiatum ducit falls into chasms, like ducere cicatricem, situm,
calorem.

98—101 animanti

Per tota errantes percurrunt corpora uenae
Aduitam sanguis omnis qua curn meat idem
Terra uoraginibus conceptas digerit auras. CS.

100 comeat Relm'. isdem Le Clerc and C θην. Schmid, con-
struo-ted with uoraginibus. Perhaps eidem.

idem of CS, which has little meaning, Ι would alter to the
dative fidem, like the abl. effidem Lucr. ii. 663, vi. 961, eadem
i. 480, iv. 744, 786, 959 (abl. fem.), e‘ziea’em i. 306. It is true,
Cartault (Liz Flexion dans Lucrbce, p. 67) shows that the dative
eidem, like the acc. plur. eosdem, easdem, the gen. plur. eorundem,
earundem, and the dat. and abl. plur. isdem, is not found in the
MSS. of Lucretius: but isdem, the coriection of Lambinus for
idem in ii. 693, of Pius in v. 349, is accepted by Munro and
most editors except Lachmann: and the poet of Aetna might
follow the Lucretian tendency to disyllabize these forms without
binding himself by his particular exceptions. Catullus has εἶ’,
lxxxii. 3. Manilius iii. 73 has pars semper ut eidem Confim's
parti where Bechert's three MSS. LCF give idem, G eidem.
Omnis, eidem correspond: ‘all the blood passes to and fro to
sustain the life osthe same one being.' With ad uitam, ‘ for the
support of life‚’ cf. Sen. ad Marc. xviii. 5 ced uilamfruclus seges
et arbusta.

102—117. The explanations ofthe cavei-nous and unsolid fabric
of the Earth commencing with Scilicet aut are not continued till

the poet, wishing to illustrate his first explanation, introduces‘
the simile of a heap of stones‚ and this interruption occasions
