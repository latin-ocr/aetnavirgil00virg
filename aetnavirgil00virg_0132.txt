AETNA

At this point my plan calls on me to explain the
artificer and cause of the fire, a cause of no little
or slight significance: it is overwhelming, and will
lay before you a thousand truths in a moment of
time. Facts and eyes are our teachers‚ facts force
belief unassisted. Moreover Ι would suggest to you
to handle and touch, if it might safely be done3
but the flames forbid, and there is a fire to keep
guard upon Aetna's working which shuts off all
approach, since the divine providence which governs
creation will have no witness of its action, so to
heighten the show, and not relieve the mountain
ineffectually. All will be the same, but you are
to see it from a distance: none the less it is no
matter for doubt what it is that makes Aetna writhe
within, or who is the wondrous workman that directs
a craft so mighty.

A cloud of ignited sand is driven out in a whirl:
burning masses hurry up, the substructions are rolled
from the bottom: at one moment a crash bursts

from every part of Aetna, at another wan flames
