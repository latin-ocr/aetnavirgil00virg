COMMENTARY

nominative therefore to sorbet would seem to be aer or a corre·
sponding word, which has perished with the verse or verses
following 350—352 and returning to the main subject of the
whole digression (328-356)‚ the tranquil state (under ordinary
circumstances) of the air at the top.

354 Jacob thought that humus might represent a superlative
termination, and altered plantis humus into lentz'ssimus. It is
more probably placidissimus. The same confusion of n with ci
is found in Manil. v, 480 nunc tanto gestu for tacito, again ii. 9
lances for latices.

excita predas I believe to be a corruption of excit apludas.
The first of these two words occurs in Stat. Theb. iv. 146 suus
eicit in arma Antiquam Tiryntha deus; a passage cited by
Priscian (i. 476, Keil); Neue—VVagener, iii. pp. 287-289, show
that cit (Colum. vi. 5. 1), concil (Lucr. vi. 410), percit (Lucr. iii.
303) are Classical and good forms.

apludas=paleas‚ ‘pieces of chaff‚' a rustic word according
to Gellius xi. 7. 5 apludam ueteres rusticos frumenti dixisse
smsurem ; Pliny xviii. 99 Milz· et panici et sesz'mae purgamenta
apludam uocant, a passage which shows that in the middle of
the first century A.D. it was a commonly recognized word, and
enough to protect it, as at that time current and understood,
against the much later sneers of Gellius. Gon, Thes. Glossarum
Emendatarum s. v.‚ cites numerous Glossaries for the word;
in these it assumes four shapes, apluda, abluda, aplunda,
ablunda, the last still further corrupted as abunda in the San
Gallen Glossary edited by Prof. Minton &Varrem To these
n forms the aprendas of Relzd. and Αν. in the verse of Aetna
seems akin‚ but Ι have not found any trace of r (apruda) in
the passages where the word is undoubted. The first syllable
would naturally follow the analogy of aplustre, which is either
long or short. κινεῖν κάρφος is almost proverbial in Greek.
Arist. Lysistr. 474 κινοῦσα μηδὲ κάρφος, where see Blaydes;
Herond. i. 54 οὐδὲ κάρφος ἐκ τῆς ’γῆς l κινέων, ili. 67 κιυεῦντα μηδὲ
κάρφος.

355 Scaliger’s correction odoratis would be like Ovid’s
adoratis Ignibus (M. xv, 574, Pont. iii. 3. 40, F. i. 75, in the
two latter combined with ara) ancl refer unmistakably to the
