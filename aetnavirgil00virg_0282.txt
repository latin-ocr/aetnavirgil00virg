406 coritur is defended by Sudh. = moritur, ‘rises to meet
in battle‚’ like szjgno dato coorti pugnam ediderunt, Liv. vii. 9,
and he shows (after a remark of Hildebrandt’s) that the molaris
is specially designated as πυρίμαχος or πυμομάχος (Arist. Met.
ἰν. 6, Theophr. lap. ix. οἱ πυρομάχοι καὶ οἱ μυλίαι). But (1) the
contractiori coritur does not seem to exist in Latin poetry ; (2)
moritur zjgmz' for oritur contra ignem cannot ¹ be paralleled.

Of the conjectures, Baehrens’ carpitur is faulty, as a form of
corripitur not found and ill-supported by Horace’s surpuerat,
surpite (C. iv. 13. 20, S. ii. 3. 283), Lucretius’ surpere, ii. 314.

Alzingeffs carpatur, though excellent in sense and Vergilian
(Aen. iv. 2), is somewhat remote from the letters of corz'tur.
cogitur, ‘when it is forced‚’ or ‘under compulsion of fire‚’ besides
suiting the passage as the most natural word, is not a mere con-
jecture, but is found in v, and may come from an early source.

407 is aptly compared by Alzinger with Ciris 163, 164 Quae
simul ac uenis hausit sitientibus ignem Et ualidum penitus con-
cepit z'n ossafurorem 3 a parallel which makes Munro’s concepta
in 413 almost certain.

The genitive hausti (a neuter like G. ii. 398 Cui numquam
exhausti salis est) depends on domus, ‘home of what it has
imbibed ’ ; yet Scaliger's haustis is also possible, a dative rather
than abl„ ‘yet once absorbed they (the flames) have no safer
home.’

408 Scaliger's clm-amque for duramque of MSS. seems very
likely, as duramque can only be retained on the improbable
view that seruans aciem duramque can=seruansque a. d.; if
durans is right it almost follows that saepta is an accus. plur. as
Wernsdorf thought: not, however, in the sense he assigned,
‘quae intus conclusa sunt,' but either the outer walls which close
round the central seat of flame‚ or perhaps the partitions into
which the molten lava-masses fall by the action of heat. Lucre-

¹ Birt, who however himself retains corilur, changing rgni to rgm's,
as in Liv. xxvi. 27. 5.
