THE EXCERPTA PITHOEANA

261 Tum demum uiles taceant inopesque relictae.

So C. Gyr. had humilesque iacent, whence Matthfae (1797)
conj. ut‘les iaceant as D'Orv.

268 Grata leues cruciant animos et corpora causae. C.
Bahrens (1880) conj. curae : and so D'Orv.

269 Horrea uti saturent tumeant et dolea musto.
So C. The reported reading of Gyr. is tumeant ut; and
so D'Orv.

278 (257) Scrutamur rimas et uertimus omne profundum.

So C. euerm'mus of D'Orv. is also a late eighteenth-century
conj. of Schrader's.

281 Concrescant animi penitus seu forte cauernae.

So C. Scaliger corrected concrescant to cur crescant, and so
D’Orv. Probably Pithou took it from Scaliger’s edition.

290 Praecipiti delecta sono premit una fugatque. C.
unda Scaliger : and so D’Orv. probably from Scal.

291 Torrentes auras pulsataque corpora denset. C.
curas is in Scaliger's 1572 edition, and was left uncorrected
by him. The right reading auras in not only in C, but in Relad.
and most MSS. as well as Ald. 1517.

398 Vera tenaxque data est sed maxima causa mola acris. C.
The V.l. Sera is new, but what meaning can it bear?

400 Quem si forte manu teneas ac robore cernaS. C.
robora is a conj. of Le Clerc (Corallus) : and so D'Orv.

423 In cinerem putresque iacit delapsus harenas. C.

iacens of D'Orv. is strange ; it is not an improvement, and can
hardly be a modern emendation. Did Pithou draw it from
a lost codex? It is not one of the variants of Gyr. The real
doubt in this passage is between iacit of C and iacet of Relul.
and Arund. For iacens there can be no place: but its futility
makes it noticeable.

428 Dicitur insidiis flagrans enarea quondam
Nunc extincta super testisque neapolin inter
Et Cumas locus. C.
Very remarkable are the notes of D'Orv. here (1) on 428 in m.

lxxxvii
