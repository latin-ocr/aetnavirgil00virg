THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

was transferred from Cos to Rome by Augustus, and dedi-
cated in the temple of Julius. If it was in Rome, how
could the poem speak of it as a work to be visited
abroad?

More recently, Alzinger (Studia in Aetnam Collata, Fock,
1895) has re-affirmed this second argument. He shows
that of the four works of art mentioned in the poem, the
Venus of Apelles, the Medea of Timomachus, the Iphigenia
of Timanthes-the Heifer of Myron ¹, the first two and the
last were removed to Rome, the Venus by Augustus, the
Medea by Julius Caesar (who bought it in his dictatorship
(Plin. 35. 26), with the same painter’s Ajax, for 80 talents,
and placed them both in the temple of Venus Genstrix),
the Heifer, between the age of Cicero and Antoninus, it
is not known exactly when. Proceeding to minuter detail,
he goes on to show that the Venus which, when Cicero
delivered his Verrine orations (70 Bc), was at Cos, and
which Augustus transferred to Rome (Suet. V esp. 18), in
the interval between that time and the reign of Nero, fell
into decay ², and was then replaced by a new picture from
the hands of Dorotheus3 (Ptin. 35. 91). We are thus
placed in a double difficulty: if the author of Aetna lived
during or not long after the era of Augustus, he should
have known that the Venus was no longer in its native
place, but in Rome 3 if he lived in or after the reign of
Nero, he should, or at least might, have known that it
was no longer in existence at all. This difficulty is intensi—

³ Miss Sellers, however (comment. on Plt'ny’s Chapters on tlte

History of Art, p. 128), thinks it may have been still in existence

under Vespasian (Suet. Vesp. 18).
