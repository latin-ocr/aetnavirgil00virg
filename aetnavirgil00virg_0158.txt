way strip away its solid strength, you shall see it
fused quicker than iron 3 for lava has a nature that
is readily affected and shrinks from harrn under
compulsion of fire. Still, when it has once abÎ‡
sorbed the flame, safer home for what it has
absorbed there cannot be, preserving as it does
its jagged edge, and hardening its several party-
walls with a stubborn fidelity: once overpowered
its submissiveness is that of an insensate thing.
Scarcely ever is it known to reassert its strength
and discharge fire. For being throughout a coal-
like mass of close-packed strength, it admits and
feeds its fires only through narrow channels, and
after they have once been drawn in relaxes its hold
upon them tardily and with reluctance. Yet think
not, that because lava forms the largest portion of
the mountain, this fact alone gives it predominance
and makes it the central source of combustion: in
very truth the vitality and determination of the stone
is extraordinary : while all other substances that breed
fire, if once kindled, die down, with nothing left
in them to return for, a mere mass of embers and
earth that has no germ of fire 3 this lava-stone readily
submitting again and again, and with a thousand
fires successively absorbed, goes on to new strength,
and ceases not to do so till its heart has been burnt
out of it and it falls into ashes exhausted, a light
pumice-like substance: throwing off when dissolved
a crumbling sand.
