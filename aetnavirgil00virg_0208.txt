AETNA

magis penitus inclusi sunt : eo magis necesse est uincla soluant
et obstantia pellant.’

It is rather against this that the clauses are then very
unequally balanced; the long protasis with its two-sold division
(a) quo liberior quoque animosior ignis est in inclusis, (b) el quo
uentis non segnior ira est sub terra, penitusque mouent hoc
pluro, is out of proportion to the short apodosis necesse est
uincla magis solumzt, magis p. obstantia: again, lzoc in 148 is
somewhat loosely connected with penitus ⁴ deep below as they
are, the winds cause proportionably greater turmoil.’ This would
be obviated by making the apodosis begin after penitusque, and
changing mouent to nouem. T hen sub terra and penitusque
are co-ordinate ‘ under ground and deep within (the earth)‚’ cf.
Sen. N. Q. vi. 24. 3 (illollts est) subter et ab imo, Lucr. iv. 73

ment,’ ἀνάγκη πλείω νεωτερίζειν, like omnia nouare, Liv. xxxV.
34. The three clauses each with its comparative, lzoc plura
nouem, magis solmml, magis obstantia pellant, thus form an
effective sequel to the elaborate introduction of the two and
a half vv. which precede. Between incluss‘s ancl incluso (Gyr.)
there is little to choose z incluso might be an euphonic emenda-
tion, yet may well be a genuine tradition of antiquity. But on
general grounds 1 prefer to retain inclusis, not only as given by
S and the fifteenth century MSS„ but as confirmed by the
variation of form which it has assumed in C? inclusics.

The sondest admirer of Gyr. will not claim much for it here.
