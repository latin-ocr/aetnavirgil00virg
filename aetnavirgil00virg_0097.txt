A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF ‘AETNA'

has its parallel in the passage of Aetna where the poet,
passing from the sublime phenomena of the heavens, insists
on the study of earth as only second in importance, however
much rnan may misuse it for his own slight purposes, and
turn what ought to be a losty investigation into a mere
occasion of greed (250-270). It is perhaps a mere accident
that in the list of trees which both writers give, not only the
vine and the olive, but the comparatively unfrequent plane,
is included (vi. 37, Aeta. 265).

Of the sea alone, our poet says little or nothing3 but the
description of the Mediterranean and its islands in the
Περὶ Κόσμου seems to have been known to another Roman
poet, Manilius, iv. 595 sqq.

II. The following points of agreement are of a more
special kind. 1 mention them safarim, beginning with the
less important, and ending with the more striking and
significant.

1. In the opening section of his treatise the writer of the
Περὶ Κόσμου contrasts the impossibility of the human body
attaining to the sight os the heavenly region with the tran-
quil and unimpeded contemplation of the same region by
the philosophie soul. The folly of the former aspiration is
illustrated by the example of the Aloadae, giants who tried
to ascend the sky by piling Ossa on Olympus, Pelion on
Ossa (Apollod. i. 7. 4).

This story of the giants invading heaven is similarly
introduced by the poet of Aenea as a mythological expla-
nation of the volcano's eruptions: it was a popular belief
that Enceladus was buried under Aetna in punishment sor
the giants' attempt. But whereas in the Περὶ Κόσμου the
myth is only alluded to, in the poeni it occupies a prominent

place, and takes up no less than twenty-three lines (41-73).
