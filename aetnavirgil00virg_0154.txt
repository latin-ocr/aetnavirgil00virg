meeting of the branches the fire spreads on.

Beware, again, of being misled by the insensate
rabble’s lies, as if the hollows of the mountain lost

giving them the power to grasp their forces again
and bring them back to battle after defeat. Away
with a thought so foul, throw from you rumour with

divine or begs for petty supplies, or asks for small
contributions of air. Ever there are workrnen at

cause you do not see, strong enough to interrupt the
passage, and compel obstruction. Often sorne rocky
mass piled up with fallen boulders chokes the gullies
and closes up the avenues against the wrestling of the
winds at the bottom, keeping them, as it were, close
pent beneath an impenetrable weight. Or it holds
thern in check by a similar obstruction‚ when the
mountain is cold and sluggish‚ and the winds are
free to pass down it unmolested. After a while, when
they have first sunk into silence, they press on all
the swifter for the stoppage‚ confront and repel
the masses of rock, burst their bonds asunder,
