COMMENTARY

a seeming anacoluthon (Hildebrandt‚ Philologus sor 1897,
p. 117), intelligible enough, but unlike the usual style of Aetna.
If any correction is required, it would be easy to change aut
into ante. The combination ante olim, ‘ in some longpast time,'
would be justified by the similarly defining ablatives with (vlle,
anno, quinquennio, sex annis, non &172ng temporibus ante
(de Rep. ii. 59), or adverbs iam ante, saepe, saepim, semper
antea, all in Cicero ¹. If ante olim is right, there is no pause
after sidera, as if sors data began a new sentence : the construc-
tion is Scilicet, diuiso ante olim c. m. in maria ac t. et sidera,
sors prima data (est). caelo.

ereb-rer of C, creber of S, are no doubt strange as a corruption
of crebro, yet the one alternative which suggests itself crebre
(Vitruvius) has no probability, and we must suppose that the abl.‚
at some'tirne before C was written, had assumed a shape in
which the termination was obscured, becoming creber in S,
crebrer in C. Reha'. has here preserved the right reading, in
spite ofits comparative lateness: attempts like Sudhaus’ to retain
creber in agreement with aceruus are uncritical and futile ².

¹ Terence has olz'm quondam, Eun. ii. 2. 15 ; Quintilian, Inst. v. 12.

denos hunc se reminiscitur annos M. vii. 292.

² Equally uncertain would be a conj. like crepam, ‘ dim‚’ leaving an
uncertain light from the small size of the interstices. The mis-spell-
ings creb3·cr creboros CS seem ascribable to the difficulty of pronouncing
the double r, which caused the commonly found omission of the second
