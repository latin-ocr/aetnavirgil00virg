AETNA'· ’“

de Const. Sapientis, v'i. 3 Vix em'm credis tantum firmitatis
in hominem cadere, where Gertz edits credas against A.]

Haupt's totiens for torrens in 119 has the merit of closing the
sentence with the antithetic mergere, ‘plunging into the ground?
xemergere (118) ‘springing from it’; imo too is the actual
reading of v (Vat. 3272), and not a mere conjecture.¹ Yet there
are so many traces of lost lines in the poem that here too
a lacuna may well have existed 3 a single line would be all that
is needed: Munro's supplement is given above; I have myself
suggested lnztall‘a'us solet, alque alio se erumpere fortem, thus
contrasting uno with also, inualida? with sortem.

120 as given by C and the other MSS. is difficult to dis-
entangle. Neither Scaliger’s uacuo nor Munro's uoczco (another
spelling of uacuo) satisfies: Sudhaus‘ quocumque is ingeniously
near uocemque, but his explanation of agat as a potential‚
‘that chasm could not draw its springs from any small and
ordinary source‚' where a pres. indic. seems required, is ill
supported by trahat in 1763 sor C, our best authority, as well
as all the fifteenth century MSS„ gives trahit, and trahat
is only a reported variant of the so-called Gyraldinus. As far
back as 1887 I suggested (J. th‘lol. xvi. p. 296) a restitution
of the line to which Ι still adhere

Non ille ex tenui uiolens ueget: arta necesse est

Confluuia‚ &o
‘be sure that torrent (ille, sc. ferrens) does not change from
a puny stream into boisterous vigour’ : the change from a small
and weak to a large and powerful body of water (uiolentior
smmis G. iv. 373, amne Ov. Μ. xiii. 802) is nothing sudden, it
is the effect of confluents. uocem for uiolens implies that the
z· fell out, ancl so in 213 uiolentia has become uolenlz'a in C.
Then uolens became uocem, to which (q)ue of neget (a rare
word easily misunderstood) was attached, the second syllable
of unget then expanding to agat. aegere, which is transitive in
Lucretius, was also used neuter. Nonius 183 Veget pro uegetas,
uel erigit, uel uegetum est. . . . Varro Manio Nec natus est nec
morietur, alget, neget, utpote plurimum. If trahat—contrahat
in 122 are rightly recorded by the MSS„ the poet must again
be playing on two senses of trahere, ‘drawing srom,' and
