PROLEGOMENA

our judgment to the impossible character of some, the
improbable character of many: and that where they are in
marked antagonism to CS, the two actually extant MSS. of
Aetna which we know to belong to an early date, we are
bound to give our first consideration to CS, our second

to Gyr¹.

¹ It may be interesting to see what was thought of the Gyr.
variants by Walch, the editor os Act. Soc. Lat. lenensis in which they
were first published in 1756. In the Praefatio to the volume Walch
writes thus z—Utrum omnes ac singulae loca male adfecta sanent et

corrupta sic n‘slitmmt, ut nulla amplius dicti isti poetae medicina egeant,
nolo equidem definire, hoc tamen certissimum est, permulta effata
Gerr-ata) harum lectionum ope optime emendari: aut certe ex collat‘s
inter se lectionibus, altera uulgari altera horum codicum, quomodo
legendnm forte sit, lzaud difficulter erm posse. lt is truc that he
includes with the Gyr. variants, two sets of variants on other poets
<dmi isti poetae„ which immediately follow. But the tone of his
judgment is unmistakably hesitating: he speaks, at best, modestly,
and with no tracc os the confidence which has led so many critics of
the ninetecnth century to place unqualified confidence in Gyr.
