THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

in antiquity‚ and could not have been passed over in silence
by our poet.

Kruczkiewicz’ art argument, which has some force as
a ground for the Augustan authorship of Aetna, loses
much of its validity when pushed to its further conse-
quences. For if the author of Aetna wrote before the
Coan Venus was removed to Rome, he must also have
written before the still earlier removal of the Medea, since
travellers from Italy are described in the poem as visiting
Greece and Asia to see both. But in shifting the date from
Augustus to Julius or the years immediately following Julius'
death, he lands us in critical difficulties of an insuperable
kind. We have before us a poem not only written in a
highly artificial style, but with a general dependence, alike in
the structure of the hexameter and the choice and arrange-
ment of words, on the author of the Georgics and Aeneid.
If we follow Alzinger, the immediate predecessors of our
poet were Catullus, Lucretius, and perhaps, for this also
is uncertain, the author of the Dirae. In none of these,
can any real resemblance to the style of Aetna be dis-
covered. All of them agree in a common simplicity of style
which may be best described as the language of poetry
still incompletely developed, all of them have recurring
peculiarities of metre which mark off the pre-Augustan
period of Roman literature, and were either disused or
used much more sparingly by Vergil and his successors.
Thus Lucretius abounds in pentasyllabic endings frugifer-
entis indupedita principiorum. Catullus repeats to monotony
the Ciceronian cadence prognatae uertice pinus, and the
spondiazon preceded by a dactyl Nereides admirantes,
flagrantia declinanti, carmine compellabo 3 the Dirae, as was
remarked by Nake, in 113 lines, contains eight instances
