COMMENTARY

mur, spisso for scisso, uentos sor montes. After such an admis-
sion to find no difficulty in 376, is (critically speaking) to strain
the gnat, and swallow the camel.

2. The connexion of the clause cum srljgt‘da monti Desidia est
tutoque licet discedere with the rest of the sentence is obscure
and only just intelligible. It would seem to mean, the mass of
debris makes the winds feeble and so changed from their normal
strength as to be unrecognizable‚ the volcano being now inactive
and descent from it possible without the danger which attends
an eruption.

Against Buecheler’s retention of scisso, on the ground that the
rents in the mass of obstructing rock are the cause of the winds'
diminished violence, as affording them an outlet, 1 would urge
that the poet’s object is here to state the causes of obstructz'on
(Causa latet quae rumpat iter cogatque morari), not to introduce
details which dimim'slz that obstruction‚ such as openings in the
mass of superincumbent rock or debris.

Baehrens’ unsavourable judgement on the various conamina
which preceded his edition, must extend to his own. I regard
all these suggestions as undoubtedly wrong. My own view was
first stated in the Journal qultilology for 1887, p. 304.

In 374 it seems probable that luctamur was closer to the
archetype than the v.1. given in C luctatur. Rehd.'s luctamine
would account for the m and might come from an old source3
certainly does not look like a correction. Munro’s explanation
satisfies ‘against the turmoil below' on the analogy of munire ab
found in Sallust, Horace, Columella, Livy (Lucr. iii. 820). In
Postgate's C. P. L. ii. p. 73 Ι keep luctatur, sc. congeries, the huge
mass of rock wrestling in turn with the winds which follow one
aster another as so many ἕφεδροι, cf. the passage of Cicero's
de fillo (xiii. 30) cited by Key, s. v., in which lactabilur Olympiis
Milo is said to be permissible because luctari implies an adver-
sary. But it would be the winds (Sen. N. Q. vi. 18) which more
properly wrestle with the obstructing rock3 Ι have therefore
returned to luctamine.

In 375 I write teclo[s] sub pondere, the s having fallen out
before sub. This change seems to me necessary and almost
certain. tectos praestat, ‘keeps them securely covered,’ would
