PROLEGOMENA

body of excerpts drawn from a source not practically
different, yet exhibiting lections which at times diverge
from CS, at times correct them. We have on the other
hand a number of fifteenth-century MSS. all more or less
vitiated‚ yet not without their use, as at times preserving
what seems likely to be the original reading. Between
these two classes we can, of course, have no difficulty in
deciding which to follow. CS, and especially C, are our
only safe guides ; the other class is comparatively of little
account.

But we are now confronted with a problem of some
difficulty. For in addition to the sources already mentioned
we possess a number of various readings on one portion
of Aetna (138-285) which profess to be derived from a far
older codex than even C, and which include some correc-
tions of such excellence as to warp the judgment of critics
into believing that in this body of variants we possess an
uncorrupted tradition which outweiins all our other sources.
This is practically the view of Jacob and Haupt: Bahrens
made of them a first class, to which all other MSS. are
subordinate : he has been followed even more pronouncedly
by Wagler‚ Hildebrandt‚ and Sudhaus. This was not so
always. W ernsdorf when editing Aetna in his Poetae Latt'm‘
Minores (1785) used them with hesitation: Munro, though
sometimes adopting themy did not scruple at times to reject
them in favour of C: my own feeling, which originally went
beyond Munro in his acceptance‚ changed as soon as the
real test of comparison, the two MSS. CS, had become
more minutely known by personal inspection, collation‚ and
transcripticm¹> and this doubt has found expression in
various papcrs communicatcd to the sazawa! of Philology
