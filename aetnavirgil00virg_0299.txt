COMMENTARY

stones would prepare the way for the comparison of these
rock-heaps to a kiln. Ι prefer to make ang. u. surg. the apod.
to ubi: ‘they rise with a narrowing apex‚' i.e. narrow gradually
as they mount upwards. [Le Clerc conj. sursum, Jacob
surgens]

479 sic ueluti, ‘just as in a kiln ⁹: sic adding to the exactness
of the description.

fornace is a very general term: ‘here it clearly means a
fornax calcaria or lime-kim, fully described by Cato, de re
Rust. 383 his proportions are 10 feet broad at bononi, 3 at top,
20 high3 and hence we get a good notion of how a heap of
these stones would go on burning till reduced to cinders, after
the loss of the part that turns liquid,’ Munro.

480 subit altius, if rightly given by MSS.‚ refers to the lime-
stone in the kiln, not to the lava which is compared with it: for
the fluid part of lava is immediately described not as evapora—
ting, but as pouring down the mountain in a gradually increasing
flood. [Baehrens conj. abit altilis] Transl. ‘Just as in a
lime-kiln the stone is calcined‚ losing in evaporation the whole
of its fiuid part when burnt out in the veins of the stone.'

481 opibus, its weahh, what gives it value or importance
among its brother stones : its real substance.

leuis et sine pondere pumex Excutilur, ‘it is sifted off a light
imponderable pumice'; nearly= quod eius excussum est fit
pumex. Vitruvius mentions a kind of pumice called spongia
about Aetna, ii. 8. 3.

482 liquor, the fluid lava which gradually swells into a flood.

483 mitis is ill supported by Vergil’s Mitis ut in morem
stagni placidaeque paludis Sterneret aequor aquis, Aen. viii. 88
for no one would think of comparing a lava-flood with a lake or
marsh: if genuine it must refer to the slow motion of the liquid
in its first beginning, before it assumes its more rapid and
destructive character. This would suit tandem Incipit. No
conj. of any likelihood has yet been offered.

484 prunis C: primis Arund.: pronis Suringar‚ and so
Munro. It is difficult to decide: primis need not imply more
than that at whatever point in the crust the lava broke out,
it began with pouring down the slopes of the hills, then by
