AETNA‘

(Tome lvii. p. 597): inulto ‘une paix faite par un traite sans
garant, dont l'infraction ne sera pas vengee': muto would of
course refer to the silence which sets in when the winds’ fury
ceases. Both emendations are elever, but multo foedere is,
I think, as good, and is supported by all MSS. including L.
Munro compares multa pace Tac. Hist. i. 77, iv. 35.

281 concrescant (= concrescantne, cf. Prop. iii. 5. 31, 39)
if genuine must mean ‘come to growth,' ‘ grow gradually,' the
various elements of the winds’ fury massing their forces till
the explosion is effected. But, though this is a possible sense,
concrescere is so regularly used not of qualz'lz'es like animi (tage,
violence), but of actual substances or products of nature (snow⁹
ice, water, διε.) as to make the word doubtful. Scaliger's Cur
crescant is the easiest substitute hitherto offered.

[animae of L and Gyr. = airs, as animam 297, animae 3 58.]

283 tenues : impalpable, a good and seemingly right reading
of L and Gyr. Lucr. vi. 104 lam tenues quam sunt nebulae
fumique uolantes and 463. [My conj. niuis would be like
Catull. lxiii. 70 where niue has been corrupted into nene]

284 lzoc: probably abl.‚ ‘the more fully for this’: it would
not be impossible to take it as explained by abstrahat auras,
‘ this too the rnore fully, because.’

νζξίιίσ, ‘ stark.' Ov. Μ. viii. 797 regulique cacumine montis
( Caucason appellant) .

surgit of C I retain, as 285 is doubtful.

285 infestis (Jacob) for infestus of all MSS. except L (= Gyr.)
seems right. obnoxia, ‘exposed to.’ Colum. x. 75 Verberibus
gelidis iraeque obnoxia Cauri. [Ι am persuaded that our poet
could not have written, as Sudhaus edits, Illinc infesta est alque
hinc obnoxia uentis. A more inept verse could hardly be
imagined]

286 The meaningless ¹ cogitat was well corrected by Schrader
and Mahly into cogz'lur; VitruV. viii. 3. 10 a solis et aeris calore
cogitur congelari. With this Vnaque for Vndique of MSS.

¹ Hildebrandt (Philologus sor 1897, p. 103) does not persuade me
that cogitat, ‘is minded,' stands on the same footing with uidet in 337,
both ascribing to Etna a personal will.
