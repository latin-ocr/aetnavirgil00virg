COMMENTARY

possess a larger and clearer delineation in a mosaic found at
Nennig, not far from Treves‚ published at Bonn by XVilmowsky,
1864s5. To judge from these and the figure in Heron's Pneu-
matica (227), the organ, to the eye, presented two distinct parts,
a lower case or box into which the water was poured‚ and which
contained the mechanism for making it act on the air to be
conveyed to the tubes, and above it a series of bronze pipes,
generally (but not in the Nennig mosaic) ascending in grada-
tionally adjusted lengths. In the mosaic, the performer is
stationed on the side of the instrument turned away from the
spectator, over which his head is figured rising: his feet and
hands are not seen, but the impression given by the mosaic
is that he is playing on keys, and that his feet do not touch
the ground. The shape of the case both in the coin and the
mosaic is hexahedral, whereas Heron's name for it, βωμίσκος,
might rather seem to point to a circular shape, such as was
frequent in small altars: but this is a detail which may well
have varied with different makers.

296 Imparz'bus modis: the height of the tubes is unequal,
as each rises above the next, like a Pan’s pipe; the modi
similarly. This is very distinctly stated in the Latin poem
describing a hydraulis¹ of Publilius Porphyrius Optatianus,
best given in Pithou's Epzjgrammala et Poematia uetera ‘ex
vetustissimo codice Franc. Iureti,’ p. 243, ed. 1590. It contains
twenty-six hexameters, the first having twenty—five letters, the
second twenty-six, and so on to the last, which has fifty3 the
whole thus representing in its gradual crescendo the series of
tubes which form the sounding part of the orgari: 15, 16
