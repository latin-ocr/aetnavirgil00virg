PROLEGOMENA

bodies and the periodic revolution of the seasons; as by the
marvels which the earth exhibits, with its seas and rivers, its
caverns and subterranean spaces, its exhalations‚ mins, rnists,
snows, frosts, thunders, lightnings, and especially wz'nds.

The planets are treated ii. 7, and their names given
ii. 8 and 9 3 the zodiac, ii. 7 3 the regularity of the seasons,
v. 93 and the relies which creation feels from their alter-
nation, v. 13. With this compare the fine passage of
Aetna 230—245.

The earllz is described, ii. 1, iii. 1-7, as a storehouse

and sount of hidden fire (Lipara, Aetna), iv. 263 of wind,
which in the struggle to escape, produces earthquakes, iv.
29. The sea, iii. 8 sqq. ς rivers, river-exhalations, hail, δια,
iv. 1—33 wind, iv. 103 its connexion with fire in lightning
and thunder‚ iv. 17, 18, 19, 20.
Α Most of these topics are included in Aetna, some of them
at great length,'e.g. the action of wind, which forms the
staple of the poem, and is declared to be the main cause
not only of volcanic eruptions, but earthquakes‚

Hinc uenti rabies, hinc saeuo quassat hiatu

Fundamenta soli: trepidant urbesque caducae
Inde.

In the poem, again, much is said of the effects of water
and of exhalations from rivers or springs (310-316)‚ and an
argument is drawn from the action of moisture as we see it,
to its unseen action in the bowels osthe earth. Even the glow
os feeling with which the author os the Περὶ Κόσμου describes
(iii. Ι) the earth as ‘teeming with plants and animals,
and diversified with countless forms of verdure, high moun·
tains, deep-timbered forests, cities founded by that marvel

of cleverness‚ man, islands snrrounded with sea, continents,'
