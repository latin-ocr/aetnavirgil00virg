AETNA

mastered with iron mols, till she buy herself off with
a price paid down, and after declaring her true secret
is then at last reduced to silence and left to contempt
and poverty. Whole nights and days the farmer
presses on the tillage of his fields, hands harden
with country work, we weigh with care how each
soil is to be used: this is fertile and fitter for
bearing corn, another for vines: this earth is best
suited to the plane-trec, this to grass-crops: this other
is hard and better for feeding cattle, a steady friend
of forest-trees: the drier grounds are the horne of
olives, elms love a juicier soil. Triviai are the causes
that torture men's minds and bodiesâ€”to make their
barns overflow, to see their wine-casks distended with
must, their hay-racks filled to the top with the
mowings of the field. Thus ever ye advance on your
path of greed where something more precious comes

in vieW.
