COMMENTARY

It is hardly probable that si should here be an earlier form of
sic, as it certainly is in the fragments of the satirist Lucilius
(see Key's Diclz'onary, s. v.), and perhaps in si dis placet.

cessata, see on 69.

384-386 are thus given in C:

Nunc superant quaecumque regant incendia siluae
Quae flammas alimenta uocent quid nutriat aethnam
Incendi poterunt.

384 regnant v: tegunt jacob: quae iam generent Maelcly:
rigant Mauro: creant Wagler: gerant Baehrens 385 flammis
a. uocant (= uacant) Munro quid v: quod Reha'. Αν.;
quod (= quoad) nutriet Aetna llIunro.

The structure of the sentence seems clearly indicated by the
last words Incendz· poterunt. They form, 1 think, the apodosis
to the two νν. preceding. Ι would compare two passages of
Grattius' Cynegetzta, 454-456:

Illum agat infandae comes huc audacia culpae3
Discet commissa quantum deus ultor in ira
Pone sequens ualeat.
‘Let the criminal approach this shrine: then he will learn
how powerful is an offended god.’
lb. 461—463 :
Nec mora; si medias exedit noxia fibras,
His laue praesidiis adfectaque corpora mulce:
Regnantern excuties (T. Johnsonfor excutiens) morbum.
‘ WVash and foment the ulcerous limbs with these remedies, and
you will drive the disease out.’
Aetn. 403—405 :
hunc multis circum inice flammis,
Et patere extorquere animos atque exue robur.
Fundetur ferro citius.
‘ Submit the lava-stone to the action of a furnace and it will fuse
quicker than iron.'

On this hypothesis, 384, 385, should contain an imperative:
this is regant, apparently an error for regent (subj.): nunc
siluae rzggent quaecumque superant incendia, ‘now let the sorests
of Aetna rain all their abundant stores of fire: they will kindle
without difficulty.’
