AETNA

summit, at least not the crater, of Aetna, but of the external
phenomena which present themselves to the eye from whatever
side the mountain is observed: Plurima namque patent z'llz'
miracula monti. It has huge openings which the sight cannot
fath0m3 here its centre protrudes irregularly outwards, then
corrects itself and recedes inwards : at another place is crowded
with rocks crossing each other in absolute confusion. artus
ought not to be too much pressed 3 the idea of the out—sprawling
limbs of the imprisoned giant is doubtless suggested, but we
need not particularize further. engl't is strictly Classical, and
in perfect keeping with uldra. Stat. Theb. ii. 41 longos super
‹zeqzwmfines Emgn atque ingens medio natat unda profundo,
of Taenarus projectz‘ng a long shadow on the sea. (2) scissae,
‘riven’ (Munro), is no improvement on spissae, which pictorially
brings the crowding· of the rocks before the eye, and of which
discordiaque ingens is an amplification. (3) aliae would not
oust varies even if we could appeal to an actually existing MS.
to prove it a bona fide reading: we should still doubt whether
narses did not conceal a likelier word. My suggestion uarie is
in no way violent and seems to express aptly the multifarious
forms in which the rocks cross each other.

In 187 incendii ofGyr. looks genuine. It falls under the same
category of manuscript mis-spellings as the fuller forms iuuerint
for inerint Catull. lxvi. 18, consuezcerczs for consueras Sapph. 130,
ed. de Vries. This incendii perhaps caused the strange cor-
ruption in Sv incendia: isso it was earlier than Xlth cent., and
may have been in the supposed VIIIth or IXth cent. codex
which Cyraldus is said to have copied.
