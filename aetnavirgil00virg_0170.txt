For such as is the quality of copper when com-
bined with fire and fused, unalterable, the same,
retaining its substance unchanged‚ permitting you
to recognize, whether in a fused or solid state,
the share allotted to the copper: even so our lava—
stone, whether it happens to dissolve into fluid fire
or is safe from its action, keeps and conserves its
characteristics‚ the fire has not affected its look.
Nay, there are many for whom its colour alone
disproves any alien semblance‚ without appealing
to smell or lightness; the stone decays more and
more, yet its way of working has still one un-
changed look, the earth composing it is throughout
the sarne¹. Not that I would deny the fact of
particular stones taking a glow or burning fiercely
within when once kindled: it is a specific pro-
perty which they possess. Nay the Sicilians have
given to actual stones a particular title rlzydm,
and in the very letters of the word indicate that
they possess a fusible character. Stin, these stones
never liquefy‚ though they have a more pulpy sub<
stance within to foster heat, unless their centre
has been brought into contact with the structure
of the lava-stone.

If, however, there be any that is surprised that
a stone’s core should be fusible, let hirn ponder those
truest axioms of Heraclitus’ dark treatise‚ ‘nothing
is insuperable by fire,⁷ ‘of all the seeds sown within
