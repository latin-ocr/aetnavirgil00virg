AETNA

574 lf cernere implies an actual visit, it is almost necessary that
condere should partake of the same meaning; as the traveller
views the ground where legend said Amphion and Zethus, after
rescuing their mother Antiope (piis), had summoned the rocks
to build up a new circle of walls, he is represented as realizing
the whole scene on the spot and recalling aster the lapse of
centuries every detail. Ι am here at variance with Buecheler,
who writes ‘audacter dicuntur qui Thebanas origines canunt
moenia quae fratres Zethus et Amphion condiderunt condere,
felicesque alieno intersumus aeno. Superauit iste ea audacia
Propertium iv. 1. 57 moenia se Romana disponere dicentem, at
disponere versu)

575 piis need not be changed3 it is dat. after inuitam.
The two brothers are called piens because the death of Dirce,
who had maltreated their mother Antiope, immediately pre-
ceded the building of the walls of Thebes, and the stones came
spontaneously in recognition of their filial Iove. Ov. A. A. iii.
323, 324 Saxa tuo cantu, uindex iustissime malrz's,- Fecerunt
muros officiosa nouos.

576 saxa of MSS. might possibly be explained of a stone-
altar, the fire kindled on which parted in two, dividing the
surface of the one altar into two separate altars; but ex uno
cannot well be divorced srom uapore ¹, ‘at another time we
marvel at two altars steaming from one sacrifice‚’ i. e. the sacri-
ficial flame divided into two partS‚ each of which marks off
sor itself one half of the stone on which the sacrifice is made.
Luc. i. 551 Scinditur in parles gem 'noque cacumine surgit
Thebanos imitata rogos (flamma). Saxa however can hardly
be right with saxa preceding in 575, and Scaliger's sacra is
the required word, as Ovid shows in the locus classicus on
this legend. Trist. v, 5. 33 Consilio commune sacrum cum
fiat in ara Fratribus, alterna qui periere manu, Ipsa sibi
discors, tamquam mandetur ab illis, Scinditur in parles atra
similla duas. This legend seems to have formed part of Calli—
machus’ Αἵτια, and Ovid goes on to declare that he had found

¹ As Munro suggested, reading however sacra. ‘ The construction
must be “gemina ex uno sacra, fumantia uapore.” '
