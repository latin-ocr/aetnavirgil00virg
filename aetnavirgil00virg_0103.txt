ANALYSIS OF THE POEM

Whence is the fire fed? Do the cavernous spaces and apertures
form a storehouse of air and wind? or does the earth draw
in air through minute openings in its surface, especially at the
point where the mountain rises to a peak, and is thus peculiarly
exposed to the combined assault of diverse winds? Or again,
are the clouds the agents, the water in them pressing on the still
bodies of air inside, and thus Setting them in motion? Then
we might compare their action with that of a Triton whose
trumpet is bloun by a mechanism in which water sets air
in motion, or again, with an hydraulic organ. XNe may draw
inserences from what we see outside to what happens within
the earth. The air· and spirit-particles inside Aetna jostle
each other, and in the struggle to escape crowding drag with
them anything that stands immediately in their way.

(305—327) You may object that there are other causes of wind
different from those just alleged. At any rate you will allow
that rocks tumble underground with a loud crash‚ setting in
motion the air near thern, and by its dispersion generating
wind. River-vapours, clouds that form in vasseys, or even very
small water-courses, discharge air, as we see: much more
potent must be the effect of moisture in the pent and stifling
caverns underground where we cannot trace their working.
Two comparisons may help to express their action3 waves acted
upon by violent east winds, where one breaker comes up aster
another, the last crowding on the first; again, the sipon by
which water is forced upwards and brought to bear on burning
houses.

(328-356) You are not to suppose that the wind rushes down
the same orifice by which it returns. What we see disproves
it. The same still sullen cloud is uniformly visible over the
summit ofAetna, shifting its position as the light breeze sways
it, otherwise unalterable. Again, when no eruption is going on,
incense is offered to the gods, on the very central part of the
crater. This is inconsistent with any constant action of strong
winds, ascending or descending. If then your eyes prove to
you the calm which Aetna can assume, you will not believe
that the winds which cause the explosion necessarily corne from
without. Such quiescence leads to a different conclusion.
