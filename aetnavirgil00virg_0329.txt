COMMENTARY

It would then come under the category of verses which having
first been obscured by some letters becoming illegible, were
afterwards restored to a false appearance of soundness by other
letters filled in conjecturally. This is more intelligible frorn
the rareness of dequesta, a word which occurs once in Val.
Flaccus v. 448 secum dequesta labores3 twice in Stat. T. i. 404
notos dequestus, xi. 627 Talia dequestus. Hyginus, P. A. ii. 4,
says Erigone multis miserata lacrimis her father.

[Of other views 1 signalize Haupt’s edens questum, Maass'
edens questus, both constructed with Philomela. This would
necessitate Engones (genitive). The conjecture is hardly
probable: it is undeniably prosaic, and does not explain
Euocat]

If Eratosthenes’ famous poem Ενίὲοηε1 had survived entire,
we migh hope to clear up much in the above vv. which is, and
must remain, doubtful.

585-587 phylomella canoris

Euocat insiluis ettu soror hospita tectis
Acciperis solis tereus ferus exulat agris.

The difficulty here centres in Euocat. Philomela in the re-
sounding forests issues her summons. To whom ? If we follow
Ovid, M. vi. 576 sqq„ to Procne, wife of Philomela’s ravisher,
Tereus. Philomela, ravished and with her tongue cut out
(556 sqq.), weaves her tragic fate into a piece of needlework
and sends it from her forest prison to her sister Procne. Such
a missive might be called a summons‚ and there is less harsh-
ness in the absence of a direct accusative to Euocat, because
the person summoned is immediately addressed in the vocative,
et tu soror hospita tectis Accz'perz's, in which the allusion is
to Procne, metamorphosed into a swallow, and making her
horne in cities or the houses of men.

Sudhaus supplies Ityn to Euocat. Itys is summoned or
enticed2, with the object of murdering him, in revenge sor
Tereus’ barbarous outrage.

² Longinus, de Subl. 33, calls it a faultless little poem (ἀμώμητον
ποιημάτιον).

² Sudhaus wavers greatly in interpreting Euocat: he seems to
think it may be (ι) summons, (2) calls by name, (3) entices.
