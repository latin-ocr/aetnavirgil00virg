AETNA

The difficulty of this passage is best estimated by examining
the interpretations of Munro and Sudhaus, both of whom keep
584, 585 as in C.

Munro paraphrases : ‘ You too, Erigone, are one of the uaria
carmina for which Athens is famous: so renowned a constel-
lation is now the abode of you, and yours (uestra), your father
Icarus or Icarius, and the faithful dog which became Sirius:
cp. Tib. iv. 1. 9 cunctis Baccho iucundior hospes Icarus, ul puro
lestantur sidera caelo, Erzgoneque canisque!

The weak point in this is that sedes, which as it stands in its
context suggests Athens, the horne of Erigone¹ as a mortal
maiden, is here applied to the constellation in which, with her
father Icarius and the bound Maera, she is supposed to be
located aster her death and deification. Again, sidus would be
rightly applied to Erigone as a single star, but not to a non-
existent constellation in which Icarius and Maera are grouped
with her. Lastly, the inclusion of Icarius and Maera, if thought
necessary by the poet, would surely have been done more
openly than by a side allusion like uestra.

Sudhaus tr., ‘Thou also art become an Athenian song,
Erigone, from henceforth a far-famed star: ye also have there
your home’: uestra grouping together Erigone and the Philo-
mela-Procne legend, as in Apollodorus iii. 14. This view, as
Latin, 1 consider impossible.

Peerlkamp thought sedes was a corruption of caede53 if it is
so, the murder of Icarius must be included (uestra), as Erigone
died by hanging herself for grief at her father's loss.

Perhaps the best solution may be found in D'Orv. x. 1. 6. 6
where uestras is given as a marginal v. 1. for uestra en of
Pithou's text. Suppose the original corruption of the verse
to have been

Erigone sedes uestras en philomela canoris.
we rnay reconstitute it thus :
Erigone’s (or Erigonae's) dequesta sen[em]²; philomela c.

¹ Ampelius Lib. Memor. ii says, Sunt qui Erigonam Icarifiliam
Atheniensem dicunt, which illustrates our poet's Athenarum carmen.
² Icarius is repeatedly called ’γέρων by Nonnus (Dionys. xlvii. 37,
45, 52, 58⁷ 66, 70, 78)-
