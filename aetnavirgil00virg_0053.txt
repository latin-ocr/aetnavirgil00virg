THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

The only two MSS. of the Clementine Homilies known, the
Codex Parisinus, edited by Cotelier in 1672, and the Cod.
Vaticanus <ottoboni 443), collated by Dressel and published
in 1853, both agree in Ἑρσαίου and πάλαι σοφοί. The latter
words were emended by Cotelier‚ doubtless rightly, Παλικοί,
or perhaps Παλισκοί. The former passage has been unsatis-
factorily tried by Dressel ε Wieseler conj. Θαλείᾳ τῇ καὶ Αἴτνῃ
τῇ Ἡφαίστου, νύμφῃ. Freemrm, p. 526, asks, with good
reason, ‘What is meant by Ἑρσαίου νύμφῃΡ’ and rejects
Cotelier’s suggestions that it is an error for ἑρσαίᾳ, ‘nymph
of dew‚' or χερσαίᾳ-εΐεννεςίνί, Aetna having been buried
underground.

It seems not impossible that Ἑρσαίου is a corruption
of Περσαίου. The Titan Perses, whence Perseis is formed,
is called Περσαῖος in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter 24 ,-
and it is no violent conjecture to suppose that he was
sometimes represented as the father, not only of Hecate
(the usual signification of Perseis), but of Aetna.

There is a Latin parallel to the above passage of the
Clementine Homilies in the &cognitiones ascribed to
Clement but really by Rufinus, Migne, vol. i. p. 1432.
This is ‚written in two Oxford MSS. T rin. 60 (saec. xi),
and Bodl. Rawl. C. 660 (xiii), thus :—

Eurimidus amacelai mutatus in formicam . ex qua nascuntur
mirmidon . thalian . aecnea nimpham mutatus in uulturem ex
qua nascitur apud Siciliam paliseu. Rawl.

amacelai. Trin. mirmidon (without . ) Trin. thalian ac
nea nimpam Trin. uulturem . Trin.

Reduced to intelligible Latin, this is—

Eurimedusam Acelai (Acheloi) [stuprat] mutatus in formi-
cam, ex qua nascitur Myrmidon ε Thalian Aetneam ¹ nympham
mutatus in uulturem, ex qua nascitur apud Siciliain Palicus (Ρ)
