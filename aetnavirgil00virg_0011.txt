PREFACE

THIS volume does not aspire to do more than adumbrate the
present state of cri-ticism on the many problems which the
difficult poem Aetna raises. When, in 1867, Munro gave to
the world for the first time a complete collation of the one
unimpeachable source for constituting the text, the tenth-century
Cambridge MS. Kk v. 34, he was really laying the basis of
a more exact criticism3 for though the value of C was well
known, and its readings had been used by Moriz Haupt in his
various papers and dissertations on Αείπα, no complete con-
spectus of the MS. was before the public till the great Cambridge
scholar exhibited it in its entirety.

Little was done for the further illustration of the poem till
1880 when B'ahrens edited the poem as part of the Appendix
Vergiliana in the second volume of his Poetae Latini Minores.
Munro had not included among the MSS. he employed the
eleventh century fragment of Stavelot (fragmentum Stabu-
lense): this, which had first been published by Bormans
in Bulletins de l'Acade'mie Royczle Belgiqzce, Tome xxi (18 54),
pp, 258-379, was re—collated by Bahrens and shown to agree
generally, where it could be read, with the somewhat earlier
written C. He also exhibited the readings of two Paris col-
lections of excerpts, Par. 7647 and 17903. Except in these
points Bahrens’ recension must be considered a retrogression.
Munro had been careful to point out the questionable authen-
ticity of some of the Gyraldinian variants. Bahrens boldly
adopted them all and even made of them a first class as
compared with the other MSS., C and S included. Munro
had throughout the poem kept C steadily in sight, rarely
admitting conjectures, and emending on the basis of C, where
he thought emendation was required: transposition of verses
