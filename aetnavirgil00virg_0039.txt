THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

in the last year of the war with Sex. Pompeius in Sicily
36 Β. c. Appian says (B. C. v. 117) there were loud rum-
blings and terrifying bellowings (μυκήματα) from Aetna, and
that a lava-flood was apprehended.

It would be an idle speculation to fix on any particular
name among the recorded versifiers of the later Augustan
period. Both Messalla and Valgius are known to have
mentioned the mountain, and Seneca states that each of

thern had called Aetna unique (Sen. Epist. 51. 1 tu istic
habes Aetnam, illum nobilissimum Siciliae montem, quem

quare dixerit llIessalla unicum, siue Valgius, apud utrumque
enim legi, non reperio). But though Messalla wrote Greek
verses (Catalepton ix. (xi.) 13, 14², and is mentioned by
Pliny (Ep. v. 3. 5) as a writer of trifles in verse, it is not
likely that so considerable a poem as Aetna would have
been published without his name 3 nor are the short extant
fragments of Valgius in any way like the set style of our
poem. Among the poets whom Ovid mentions in the last
of his Pontic Epistles, he names a Trl'nczcrz'us (Pont. iv.
16. 2 5), author of a Perseis. If it could be shown that
Persem: T thinis-:Aetna we might imagine that Trinacrius
wrote on his own Sicilian Titan-child, Aetna: but the
ambiguity of the word Trinacrz'us (which Osann has not.
proved to be a real name) hardly admits of so daring a·

¹ For Perses was a Titan [Apollod. i. 2. 2), and Perseis might thus
without much forcing = Titanis, the daughter os a Titan. Such a title
would well suit Aetna. According to one legend, Briareos was im—
prisoned in Aetna : this is only another mode os suggesting the same
idea, the Titanic forces of the volcano. It is os course also possible
that Trinacrius wrote on Hecale (Perseis) ε he might still be the writer
of a different poem on Aetna. Ovid &Ib- 597) makes Trinacrius:-
Sicilian. Aut ut Trinactius, salias super ora gigantis, Plurima qua
flammas Sicanis Aetna uomit, where Trinacrius is Empedocles.
