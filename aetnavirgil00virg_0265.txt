COMMENTARY

My own correction (following the line os argument suggested
on 342) is an argument by means of a composite question. lfthe
impetuous descent of earth and stones‚ which we know to happen
on the sides of Aetna, is often beyond our observation‚ may we
not similarly conclude that there are causes of volcanic action
which are beyond our ken, e. g. inward draughts of air suddenly
impinging on others and setting thern in motion? Ι suppose
tantusque to be an error for tantus-ne (somewhat as in 357
propriisque of C Reltd. Ar. is an error for proprz'isue) and leuitas
tantos a corruption of leuis astantes (sc. auras, obtained from
aura). This sense of ruinis, ‘falling debris‚’ agrees with the
ordinary use of the word3 but it is open to the objection that
the passage contains no previous allusion to any such fall of
rocks. For the position of igilur cf. Lucr. iv, 204 Quid quae
sunt igilur iam prima fronte parata ,9

347 Quodsi of C is more likely than Quod nisi or Quod m'
of the inferior MSS. Quod nisi, and to a less extent Quod ni,
are found in Cicero, but Quod nisi does not occur in Caesar
or Sallust, and is hardly classical. (Drager‚ Hister. Synl. ii.
490.) The correspondence, noticed by Walter, with Aen. ν. 49
(τῖες, nisi fallor, adest, hardly proves much. adest species,
Ι appeal to what we see.

ruinis cannot well mean the precipitations or rapid descents
(plural) of tlte winds. Munro who, if I rightly understand
him, so interprets‚ writes tantusque ruinaesi Impetus in the
singular. Yet in itself ruinis after Impetus has a genuine
look and would be quite Lucretian, as Munr. shows on vi. 729
caput ei,· 643 Finz'limis ad se conuertit gentibus ora; 636 aa'
capul amnibus,· also in v. 270: i. 58 genitalia corpora rebus.
If the poet wrote ruinis, he must, 1 think, have meant some-
thing like the fall of masses of earth and stone, which from
a distance escapes the strongest vision, yet there is else no
reference to this.

349 The one thing in this verse which is certain is that the
concluding clause did not begin with igitur. Such a colloca·
tion would certainly have been rejected by our poet as barbarous.
On the other hand the position of igitur aster three preceding
words is shown by Hand, Tursell. iii. p. 198 to be not unfre-
