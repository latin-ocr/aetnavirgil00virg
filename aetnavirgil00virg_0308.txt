the abruptness caused by the omission of est, ‘but its onset is
enormous, such that at some time in the past it crossed the
Symaethus.’ On my view, it makes little difference whether
zjgnes or ingens is read ς the real difficulty is to give ut=‘ though,'
an adequate meaning. Such a sense I find in the contrast of the
rushing lava in its liquid state, and the immobility which sets in
after it has cooled and hardened.

p. 81, ‘ It is in the fields of Catania, and in the highlands behind
them that we see, as nowhere else in Sicily, a river-system of
some considerable extent. The Symaithos drains a large part
of the island3 it receives tributaries from several points of the
compass, and their united waters enter the eastern sea by
a single mouth.’ Silius Italicus speaks of its yellow waters
rapidique colunt uada flaua Symaethi, xiv. 232.

508 ‘dies C and all MSS. pedes D’Orville. Though this
emendation is accepted by Wernsdorf‚ Munm, Baehrens, Ι ven-
ture to doubt it. For it involves two suppositions, each of
which is purely hypothetical: (1) that pe of pedes mzjglzt be
absorbed in the former pe of persaepe; (2) that des was then
changed into dies. This implies a sort of corruption in the text
of the poem which can hardly be paralleled in it elsewhere, if we
take Cas representing its earliest and best condition. And the
change is certainly not necessary: sor the masses might quite as
well be described as lying immovable for twenty days together
as buried twenty feet in the ground.’ J. cffPlzilol. 1887, p. 232.
Sudhaus has restored dies (1898). chnos is a necessary emen-
dation : uicinos can have no meaning.

509-534 Beware of clinging to the delusive belief that the
lapis molaris is not uniform in substance, but liquefies in virtue
of one of its constituent portions‚ hardens in obedience to
another, just as when potters’ clay is submitted to the action of
a furnace, it has an inner substance which suses, distinct from
the rest. It would be truer to compare the molaris with copper
under smelting3 whether smelted or not, you recognize the
c'opper3 so the molaris, whether in its liquefied state or not,
conserves its characteristics unaltered. Its black colour is alone
