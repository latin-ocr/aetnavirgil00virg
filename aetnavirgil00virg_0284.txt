AETNA

411 stipatus, ‘closely packed,’ as Lucr. ii. 67 non inser se
slzjfiata cohaeret Materies (Le Clerc).

415 Vincit has the advantage over other stones‚ and so may
be said to be the real cause (causam tenet) of combustion.

416 lapidis is a necessary correction of de Rooy's for lapidum
of all MSS. It is incredible that our poet, with all his weak-
nesses, should spoil the force of 1115 reasoning by a sudden
appeal to the wonderful character of stones z’n general, when
the very point of all he says is to prove the molaris to be
exceptionally wonderful in contrast with other stones. Sudhaus
alone retains lapidum.

419 quod repetas, ‘to go back for, or return to! Sudh. quotes
Sen. N . Q. vi. Ι. 13 circuit salum et sz' quid diu praeteriit repetit.

sine semine, ‘ with no seed or germ of future fire.‘

420 semel atque ilerum, which in Suet. Aug. 22 means ‘ twice‚’
here=‘ again and again‚’ as in Caesar, B. G. i. 31. 6. Cic. Font.
xii. 26 (viii. 16) has semel alque ilerum ac saepius.

‘and so dissolving sheds a mass of crumbling saud? Rehd. and
Arnnd. give iacet, which mcst edd. and even Sudh. prefer.

424-445 To prove what 1 say you have only to compare other
volcanic regions. In these combustible materials exist in plenty,
but they have become inoperative from the want of the lava-
stone.

iii. 299 Has adsistere equos. cauernas is thought to mean the
hollow basins which volcanos naturally form, and which, when
the fire has died out, still retain their shape. Brydone mentions
a number of such minor craters on Aetna, formed at various
periods in the lower part of the mountain, quite distinct from the
main crater. Here, of course, the poet is not speaking of these,
