COMMENTARY

‘drawing into one,' ‘accumulating' (Aen. xii. 891). ‘But it is
not impossible that he wrote compleat, or conferat, ‘ contribute.³
A subjunctive is more likely than an indic. like Baehrens’
comparal.

128 This disappearing of rivers and subsequent emerging at
a distance is mentioned by Strabo 275 as a phenomenon of
the cavernous soil Of Sicily, τὸ δὲ περὶ Μάταυρον σπήλαιον ἐντὸς·
ἔχει σύριγγα εὐμεγέθη καὶ ποταμὸν δι’ αὐτῆς ῥέοντα ἀφανῆ μεχρὶ
πολλοῦ διαστήματος εἶτ’ ἀνακύπτοντα πρὸς τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν, and he
names the Syrian Orontes, the Tigris, the Nile, the Erasinus,
the Eurotas, and the Alpheios, as such.

Two lines of interpretation are open in this passage, (Ι) mak-
ing the apodosis begin with nulla: this is the view of Munro;
(2) changing aut to haut (haud Le Clerc) to make the apodosis
begin with this. Then nulla will repeat the negative in a more
emphatic form, haul semila, nulla uia constet sontibus. This
is the view of Sudhaus.

Birt's objection that the poet would then have written non
semita, nulla, ἃς. is in my opinion conclusive against (2) or any
modification of it. It is inconceivable that the strong, correct,
and lucid non should have been rejected for the grammatically
weak, tame, ambiguous haut: to say nothing of the outrageous
hiatusfluuz‘um‚ haut which, in any case, is impossible.

In attempting to reconstruct 128, 129 on the first view (that
nulla begins the apodosis), we may premise that ni or nisi is
necessary for sz' of MSS.: unless there were channels in the
ground for water to run in, there could be no flowing streams.
But in 129 is Hospitium nominative or accusative? If we
could believe fluuium to be an error for fluuiorum (Munro),
