AETNA

642 Ditis, nom. as in Petron. de Bell. Civil. 76 Ditis pater
exlulz't oram and so Quint. i. 6. 34 (Munro). Gestz, Thes.
Glossariormn, p. 352, cites Ditis pater Πλούτων as frequently
occurring in Glossaries. Serv. on Aen. vi. 273 dicimus et lzz‘c
Dis et laic Dilis. It seems strange that Pluto should be intro-
duced here: possibly our poet follows some lost original.

644 Sed curae of C is probably a corruption of Securae
(Munro). He quotes Stat. T. viii. 14, where the shades of the
blessed are called securi, explained in the scholia of Luctatius
Placidus, by the words sceleratorum suppliciis alieni.
