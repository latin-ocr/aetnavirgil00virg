COMMENTARY

Servius says quaeritur modo, non quid dicant, nam planum est,
sed quis debeat immolari. Stat. S. iii. 5. 18 Quas autem comitem
te rapto per undas? where Statius asks his wife ‘ what do you
mean by (talking of) my hurrying you over seas ? ’ Ι consider
it indubitable that both quis and ποῖος have an expansive
meaning of this kind. [A more exact sense might be given
to quae . . . quae by supposing quae stella Saturni, quae
Alartia=¹ what house of Saturn‚ what housing·star of Mars‚'
stella thus representing domus. Censorinus sr. 3, ed. Ο. Jahn,
*Multum tamen refert, cuius quaeque stella domus, alienae an
ip5ius sit. Domus . . . est . . . Martis Scorpio et Aries . .
Saturni Capricornus et Aquarius. On this view quoe stella
Saturni would mean, which sign of the Zodiac, Capricorn or
Aquarius, in either of which Saturn houses, produces the
temperament called tenax, and which of the two signs in which
Mars houses, Scorpio or Aries, produce the bellicose tempera-
ment. This is perhaps over-sanciful.]

243 quo sidere: like G. i. 1 quo sidere terram Vertere.

244 uias maris, ‘the tracks of the sea‚’ i.e. the lines followed
in sailing. G. ii. 477 caelique uias et sidera monstret. caeli
cursus, the courses of the stars in the sky, by which seamen
are guided. This is better than to make cursus = the seamen’s
courses as marked by the stars‚ which passages like Val. F. i.
482 stellis qui segnibus usum Et dedit aequoreos coelo duce
tendere cursus might suggest.

praediscere : Vergilian, G. ii. 255, ἰ. 51 Ventos et uarium caeli
praediscere morem.

245 uolet, ‘ hurries,' in reference to Orion’s rapid motion as a
lzunter. Germ. Arat. 332 (326) Breysig pernici sic pede lucet.

Orion is associated with the dog-star, as early as Homer and
Hesiod. Il. xxii. 29 ὅν τε κύν’ Ὠρίωνος ἐπίκλησιν καλέουσι; Hes.
”E. κ. ‘H. 609 Ὠρίων καὶ Σείριοςε and Aratus assigns Sirius to
Orion as his guardian, φρουρόςε custos, Germ. 333 (327). So
also Hygin. Ρ. A. ii. 35 ,Νοηηιιίίί hunc (the Dog-star) canem
Orionis esse dixerunt, et quod studiosus ficerit uenandi, cum
eo canem quoque inter astra collocatum ; Schol. Germanic. Arat.
p. 95 Breysig‚ and again 107 quidam dicunt lucnc canem
Orionis sitisse et cum eo z‘n montibus uenationem exercuisse, et
