Φθίνουσα δ’ ἀγέλαις βουνόμοις, O. T. 25, 26.

manifesto ut credere possis: Lucretian, like ut pernoscere possis,
iii. 181 (Alzinger). Lucretius affects manifestus in this sense of
something palpable which can be appealed to as a witness, e. g.
ii. 867-9.

453 Cuius defectus ieiunus colligit zgm's C, which, if genuine,
must=‘ whose failing stores (or, scant leavings) the starved fire
gathers together’ and consumes, having no other supply. It
would be far clearer to write ieiunos, ‘the failure (i. e. diminish—
ing supply) of which gets together only spare fires! collzgere
is sometimes used of scraping together small or penurious
sums in lack of full or larger. Liv. xxxviii. 45 είζῄευι a tyrannis
castellanisque deuiis collegens: or possibly ‘whose dwindling
and starved supply (def. ieiunos) the fire gathers into one’:
defectus will then be accusative plur„ but this is less likely
because {gnis as accusative aster collzgit is supported by collegit
flammas in 454.

454 iacit, as iacit flammam, Lucr. vi. 880. simul ictu, possibly
‘ simultaneously with the blow'; Hor. S. i. 10. 86 simul lzz‘s:
Ov. Trist. V. 10. 29 simzd nobis: more probably simul is ‘at the
time it does so‚' i. e. when it discharges flame. ictu, ‘by its
impact‚' sets the material near it on fire.

456-462 are thus written in C:

Haud equidem mirum facie que cernimus extra
Si lenitur opus restat magis uritur illic·
Sollicitatque magis uicina incendia saxum
Certaque uenturae praemittit pignora flamme.
Nam simul atque mouet uiris turbamque minatus
Diffugit exemploque solum trahit ictaque ramis
Et graue sub terra murmur demonstrat et ignes.
