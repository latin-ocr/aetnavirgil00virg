In 230 et of all MSS. (as well as of Par. and Esc.) cannot
safely be changed to ut, in the uncertainty of the following v.

lunaest is what C 's luna-est points t0‚ just as manus-polium
in the Madrid Codex of Man. v. 57 points to the word being
considered a compound, manuspolz'um (Hermathena for 1893,
p. 285).

231 In reconstructing this v. the choice appears to lie be-
tween Baehrens’ cur sic and my own cursu ut. cur has the
support of Esc.‚ and it is possible that cur sic was changed
to cursu. The four Vergilian passages cited by Alzinger
(Eel. i. 43, Aen. i. 393, v. 561, xi. 133) are a sufficient voucher
for bissenos. Moreover sic would have its significance, as the
moon’s phases pass before our eyes continually.

- breuior, however, stands somewhat barely without cursu,
which defines and explains its meaning; and as pernolet of

all MSS. (including Esc.) cannot give place to peruolal, a word
seems to be lost, which was probably ut¹. Our poet is here

following Lucretius v. 618, 619 Lunaque mensibus id spatium
uideatur obire, Annua sol z‘n qno consumit tempora cursu.

¹ Wagler, ffildebrandt, and Sudhaus consider the clause Haec
breuior cursu bis senos paruolat orbes Annuus ille meat to stand
parenthetically in the indicative : but against MSS„ except that Gyr.
is said to have had peruolat.
