COMMENTARY

superflua sit! Yet Baehrens' own qua peruia is hardly probable.
1 suspect a deeper-seated corruption: tertia is sertia, que
perhaps sor per.

[Sudhaus conj. admotisque terit (or ferit) iam s. s., a very
rare rhythm in our poem.]

Vndique discordes comitum simul agmine uenti. CS.

and so A &inger-

58 discordei Munro sonitum sacobfor comitum.

It is not easy to choose between finientes —discordei‚ fauente—
discordes. The Helmstadt codex is not,in itselfi of much weight:
but discordes uenti looks like a reminiscence of Aen. x 356
magno discordes aethere uenti, and it is safer to retain it
unaltered. But I cannot agree with Hildebrandt (Philologus
sor 1897, p. 101) in admitting comitum to be genuine, though
comitum αξηιιήε--ἀκολούθων ὄχλῳ might be explained of the
other attendants of wind and storm—rain‚ hail, thunder, lightning,
ἃς] The real determining point is geminant. This does not
stand on the same footing with ingeminare (which is often
constructed absolutely as a neuter verb), but requires an accus ,
e. g. Luc. vii. 480 Excepit resonis clamorem uallibus Haemus
Peliacisque dedit rursus geminare cauernis3 Stat. Theb. vi.
765 geminatque rotatas Asnltiplicalque manus, This accus.
can hardly be fremitum (Wakefie1d): sonitmn is very near
the letters and look of comitum, and since Jacob suggested
it has found large acceptance, e. g. with Haupt, Munro,
Alzinger.

Wernsdorf explained comitum of the other winds: but surely
uenti implies the collective body.
