THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

for your purpose 3 for indeed it is constantly increasing‚ and
past discoveries do not stand in the way of future. Again,
the last comer fares best: he finds the words ready to his
hand ; he has but to arrange them differently and they
assume a new shape. Nor is he appropriating what is not
his own: they are common property: Unless I am much
mistaken in you, Aetna is making your⁴ mouth water: you
are longing already to write something fine, to rival former
efforts.’

Ι do not agree with those wh'o, like Munro, Wagler, and
Sudhaus, consider this passage to mean nothing more than
that Seneca urges his correspondent to introduce into some
poem he was writing a short description of Aetna. From
the words of Seneca, Aetnam describas im tno carmine,
it is clear that Lucilius had spoken of a poem he was
engaged upon. As he was then making a circuit of Sicily,
he might naturally weave into this poem a description of
some of its curiosities: of these· Aetna would- be one3 en-
couraged by Seneca’s letter, stimulated by his own scientific
ardour, he would make the ascent of the mountain <if he
had not done so already), then set to work to describe
what he had seen, at first perhaps as a mere episode in
his poem, afterwards, as the subject grew in its largeness
more fully upon him, as a separate work, of which the
one argument was the marvellous volcano. Our Aetna
would thus be a circumstantial reply to Seneca's appeal:
indeed the care with which he forestalls any objections
that Lucilius might urge on the ground of difficulties in
language or terminology hardly suits a short episode, but
is well adapted to a detailed description involving scientific
nomenclature and possible argumentation of an elaborate
kind. We know from Seneca's own words that Lucilius
