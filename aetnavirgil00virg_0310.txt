Most critics, I believe, will recognize here that MSS. are
corrupt. Constat before eadem is metrically faulty, and would
be an easy depravation of constan again, after uelut natura
est aeris cum domz'lmgz est, we look for an adjective co-ordinate
with eademque et robore saluo, not another final verb like constal.
Vltroque for Vtraque is one of the commonest forms of mediaeval
miswriting. Whether portam is right, or is an error, possibly
forformam, is an open question.

Sudhaus, aster Buecheler, translates 521 as the MSS. give
it, ‘ and, lo proceed a step farther (ultraque), allowing you to
recognize (when you see it) a door of bronze': the scientific
observer being supposed to find in aes, even when he sees it
in door-form, a speaking and indubitable demonstration of
the constancy with which a metal retains its natural quality
unaltered.

Vltroque, ‘ going samber: i. e. when a farther step in working
up the metal has been taken, and the bronze assumes the shape
of a door.

This use of ultraque needs the support of other instances ; it
is an awkward way, if genuine, of confirming the general state-
ment as to the constant quality of aes, by a further appeal to the
metal worked up into a particular shape, i. e. a door. To my
feeling it is loo awkward, too prosaic, to accord with the dignified,
even where matter-of-fact, Muse of our poet.

Vtraque, before or after fusing (Munro).

partem. The amount would be different. sortem, my conj.
for portam of MSS„ would express the same idea with more
particularity‚ ‘the allotted share‚' or ‘the share asszgrned' to
copper. Or, partem may mean only that in any given quantity
of mineral in which copper is present, it is easy to recognize and
distinguish the presence of copper whether before or after fusing.
This would agree with Munro’s ⁶ copper you know to be copper
after it is sused as well as before.’
