cealed himself behind the statue of the Thymbraean Apollo
and from thence wounded Achilles with an arrow. Strabo 596,
on the authority of Demetrius os Scepsis, asserts that the
tomb of Paris and Oenone was shown in the Cebrenian terri-
tory not far from Troy. Paris was himself killed by Philoctetes
with the bow of Hercules (Philoct. 1426) 3* an episode which
‘ was told by Lesches in the Little Iliad, and must have come
into the Φιλοκτήτης ἐν Τροίᾳ of Sophocles.’ Jebb on Phil. 1426.

593 rorantia parte camilli of C seems to be a corruption of
rorantis matre capilli, the letters m and p having by some
curious accident exchanged places. matre is of course the
mother of Venus, the sea-foam. The picture alluded to is
Apelles’ Venus Anadyomene, Plin.xxxv. 79, 87, and 91 Venerem

partem corruptam qui reficeret non potuit reperiri, uerum ifisa
iniuria cessit in gloriam artificis. C onsenuz't haec tabula carie,

Byzantius Caesaris dictatoris aetate Aiacem et Medeam pinxit,
ab eo in Veneris Genetricis aede positas, LXXX talentis uenun-
datas. Miss Sellers considers Pliny to have here made a
mistake as to Timomachus‘ date, and shows reasons sor
assigning the picture to the fourth century B.C.

595 The Iphigenia of Timanthes. Plin. XXXV. 73 Timanthi
uel plurimum adficit ingenii. eius enim est Iphigenia oratorum
laudibus celebrata, qua stante ad aras peritura cum maestos
pinxisset omnes praecipueque patruum, et tristitiae omnem
imaginem consumpsisset, patris ipsius uoltum uelauit quem

sacrifice, or falsified, counterseit, i.e. used sor a sham or counter-
