AETNA

Buecheler's uizcefizcta has much to support it : the shortening
of the e (zzczcfffit occurs twice in Lucretius (vi. 1005, 1017), each
tirne at the end of a verse) might be compared with calefactus,
liquefiant& vmdcsszctus, βαίξίαείιις, patceffizclzcs, rubefactus, stupess
factus, lepcj'faclus, lz'nzffaclus (Roby, ξ 994), in all of which the
e might be expected to be long. The tendency to shorten the
vowel which precedes the verb (originally perhaps a contracted
infinitive, cf.facz‘t are Lucr. vi. 962) becomes more marked after
Lucret., and gradually caused its entire suppression, in words
like calefizcia, which in Quintilian’s time had ceased to be used
in ordinary conversation. (Lindsay‚ Latin Lawzmge, p. 184.)
I do not know, however, os any instance where uaceffactus occurs,
and the prominent position of uacefit in the two vv. of Lucretius
fixes the long quantity of the e in the memory with unusual
distinctncss. Hence though not improbable, and very near to

the MSS„ it cannot be considered certain.
Far more doubtful is charibdis, which appears in S as clizrmis

lc
or carinas, in the fifteenth century MSS. assumes diverse shapes,

carambos, cmymbos, ἃς. The gloss in Placidus, Corz‘neos aceruos
quas ruslz'ci ex congerie lapidum facimzl, seems likely to contain
the word which the Aetna MSS. present so diversely: but critics
are not agreed what the word is. Deuerling prints corymbos.
Buecheler considers cormeos to be the correcter form, comparing
one of the Gromatici (p. 401. 3 Lachmann) grumos id est
congeriem petrarum, and the Hesychian words Xupnpaevic, χηριιμός,
χηριιμὺδες (add χέραβος) in all of which the idea is of a chasm,
01· space with hollows, τὰ κοιλὰ καὶ ἔχοντα κενώματηί Cf. Gom,
leesaur. Gloss. i. p. 277. That the word, whatever it was, con-
tained the notion of hollowness might seem to follow from
Nicander's mentioning snakes as lurking in such heaps of
stones (called ἕρμακες or ἑρμαῖοι λόφοι from their connexion
with Hermes, whose figure was sometimes erected above them),

r in crcb0, crebiler. erabescere, sometimes os the first, as in Bodl. Auct.
T. 2. 24 (Latin Glossary of cent. viii) cebro, frequenter, plerumque,
although srom its position between crebras and crebre this may have
been a mere error sor crebo.
