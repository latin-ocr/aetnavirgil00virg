THE DATE OF ‘AETNA'

tius, Catullus, Calvus, Cinna, Cornificius, Egnatius, Laberius,
Varius, nowhere quotes anything from Aetna. Yet, if
subrengat undis had come into the Aeneid from Aetna,
it is sufficiently remarkable to have been mentioned among
the more notable of Vergil's debts.

W hatever‚ then, the explanation of the historical difficulty
started by Kruczkiewicz and based on Aetn. 592-598—
where the poet mentions four leading masterpieces of Greek
art and proceeds to say that men travelled over land and
sea to visit them—the inference drawn from it by Alzinger
must be pronounced untenable. Aetna cannot be pre-
Vergilian.

Vergil died in 19 B.c., and the Aeneid must have been
published shortly after. The principate of Augustus lasted
on to Α. D. 14, thirty-two years later (735-767)‚ and the
question now confronts us in a new shape.

Is ‘AETNA' AUGUSTAN?

Putting aside the question about the works of art, there
are some considerations which favour an Augustan date.

1. There are no genitives in -it' like imperii. The poet
of Aetna has silenti (220), incendi, the latter three times
. (415, 439, 566). After Vergil the genitive in -ii became com-
mon, as in Propertius and the works of Ovid‚ especially the
Metamorphoses, Tristia, and Epistles from Pontus. Phaedrus
has prelii, iurgii, lzcscinz'i¹. Lucan2 has -ίί regularly,and even
Petronius in his poem on the Civil War has inspersi (243).
On the other hand Grattius ³, in his highly-finished Cyne-
