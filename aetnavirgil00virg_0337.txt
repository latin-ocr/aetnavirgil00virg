mantia ueri, viii. 723 Quam uariae lz'nguzlv, habitu tam uesti..
et armis3 and Ovid M. xv, 110 Sed quam danda neci, tam non
epulanda suerunt. Gertz, Stud. Crt't. in Sen. p. 62, shows that
it is very frequent in Seneca ¹. I therefore emend

Nec minus ille pio quam sons tam nobilis ignist„

nec minus repeats the idea of tamen, ‘none the less (for its
usual destructiveness) is it, if guilty (in the harm it did), yet
famous for a fire that respected religion!

sons and nobilis both refer to the same particular eruption,
which was, like others, dangerous to life, but differed from
others in the religious care it showed in sparing the Pious
Brethren. This seems required by the position of tam sons
quam nobilis between pio and lgnz'st.

604 Aelian fr. 2 Hercher dates this eruption as occurring in
Ol. 81 =B.C. 456-453. ‘ But I suspect there is a mistake in the
number! Bentley, Phalaris, p. 222, Wagner.

606 lapidis C rapidis Rehd. Either word would be in place
here: Ι simply follow C as the most trustworthy guide.

608 The nom. to torquet is aether, not Iuppiter. v Postgate
conj. telum for caelum, explaining torquet of Jupiter brandish-
ing his thunderbolt. But why should not torquet=whirls on,
as in Aen. iv. 482 A xem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum,
‘ expressing the diurnal motion of the heaven‚' Conington.

609 It is hard to decide between Scaliger's mollia and
Heinsius’ mitia. The former gives a better picture, suggesting
the soft wavy look of comfields, cf. Vergil’s Molli paulatim
flaccescet campus arista, Ecl. iv. 283 the latter in combination
with cultu occurs in VaJ. Fl. ii. 647, 648 mitia cultu His
etiam mihi corda lacn, a heart civilized by culture even in
savage regions. The same idea would well suit our passage3
farm-lancis brought under by tillage, i.e. reclaimed from their
originally wild state as part of the mountain and submitted
to cultivation. MSS. have millia or milia.

¹ A parallel instance to this quamquam = quam—tam occurs in Stat.
S. iii. 5. 49 Et quamquam saeui fecerunt Maenada planctus, where
quamquam is probably an error for quam lam, as Emeric de la Croix
gemmeus> edited: but here qnam is aecus. singular fem. of qui.
