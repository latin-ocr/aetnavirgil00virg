PROLEGOMENA

from beyond sea were actually in Rome, the Venus from
some period in the reign of Augustus, the Medea from the
dictatorship of³ Julius Caesar. It- is difficult to believe that
any writer living under Augustus should have ignored a fact
which the imperial policy would have made a familiar topic
of conversation. On the other hand one of the two works,
the Venus, fell into decay towards the middle of the first
century A. D. and was replaced by a new picture in the
reign of Nero. It might be said, therefore, that, as it was
no longer in existence, a writer of that time might either
not know that it had ever been in Rome, or at least safely
ignore the fact that it had been. This is, so far, rather in
favour of the later hypothesis. But it must not be for-
gotten that the three works are spoken of vaguely as
Greek pictures or statues, which arrest the eyes, and with
the indeterminate mmc—mtm—nmzc which would suit
works selected as typical specimens of high art3 and that
not only has Cicero (Verr. ii. 4. 135) combined the three
as world-famed types, but Ovid (Trist. ii. 525—7) in an
elegy written after his exile to Tomoe, mentions Ajax,
Medea, and the Venus Anadyomene as the commonest
subjects for house-painting.

EXCURSUS ΟΝ ‘PERSEISJ

Freeman in his Excursus on the Palici (Isz'st. osz'cily i.
pp. 517-530) cites a passage from the so-called Clementine
Homilies (Migne, vol. ii. p. 183), in which the writer, in
a list of the amours of Zeus, aster mentioning Eurymedusa,
from whom was born Myrmidon, continues thus—(cruvv'jAOev
Zet-5) Έρσαίυυ νύμφῃ γενόμενος γύψ, ἐξ ἧς οἱ ἐν Σικελίᾳ πάλαι
σοφοί.
