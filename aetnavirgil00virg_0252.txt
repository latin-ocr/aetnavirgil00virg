arte regentis. There can be no doubt that the ‘skill of the
controller' refers mainly to playing on keys. These are men-
tioned in Heron's description of the hydraulis: ὅταν βουλώμεθά
τινας τῶν αὐλῶν φθέγγεσθαι, κατάξομεν τοῖς δακτύλοις τὰ κατ’ ἐκείνους
ἀγκωνίσκια· ὅταν δὲ μηκέτι φθέγγεσθαι βουλώμεθα, ἐπηροῦμεν τοὺς
δακτύλους καὶ τότε παύσονται τῶν πωμάτων ἐξελκυσθέντων ¹.
Claudiam expressly mentions the fingers (erranti digito) and
even their action in depressing the keys (detrudens) lightly:
and the writers of the article Hydraulis in the Dict. of Antiq.
ed. 2 (vates and VVayte) state, ‘There is sufficient evidence
that the instrument was keyed and gave scope to the skill of
the performer.'

297 impellens: setting air in motion by agitating the water.
For this purpose in the more powersul organs bellows were
used large enough to tax the strength of young men. Publilius

Hinc atque hinc animaeque agitant, a description which
seems to suit a larger organ than the writer of Aetna has in
view, subremigat, probably with a pedal: Munro writes,
‘ Can the words imply here ‘⁴ he rows below upon the water,’' i.e.
while he is playing above with his hands, he is moving some-
thing below with his feet, which sets the water in motion?’
Such a double action of the hands and feet would be not
inconsistent with the position of the organ-player in the
Nennig mosaic. unda is the same abl. as in Vergil's tacitis
subremigat undis, Aen. x. 227, ‘in' not ‘ with’ (Sudhaus) the
water. Silius Italicus has erenugrare of a swan, xiV. 191, 192

¹ ‘When we require any os the pipes to sound‚ we must depress
the corresponding key with the fingers3 and when we require any
oftho sounds to cease, remove the fingers, whereupon the lids will
be drawn out and the pipes will cease to sound.' Woodcrost, tr. of
Heron's Pneuxnatics, p. 106.
