PREFACE

these studies in 1897 by a paper in Philologus, xvi. pp. 97—117,
which discussed (a) the Gyraldinus‚ (b) the Fragm. stabulense.
More recently in his Bez'trc'zge zur Erkldmtng des Gedz'clztes
Aetna he has made a valuable contribution to a more minute
knowledge of the diction and syntax of the poem, as my fre-
quent references to him will show. Like XVagler, and later
Sudhaus, Hildebrandt is a thorough believer in the goodness
of the Gyraldinian readings, a point of view from which Munro
had already dissented‚ and which, after my own strong dis—
claimer in the Journal os Plzilology, Alzinger, in a notable paper
communicated in 1896 to the 153rd vol. of Neue Jahrbic'clter
p. 845, Der W ert des Codex Gyraldinusfilr die K ritz'k des Aetna,
even more emphatically repudiated ¹. Alzinger had already in
his Studia in Aetnam collata re-examined the question of
authorship and, arguing on the lines of Kruczkiewicz, assigned
to the poem a date after the publication of Lucretius' de rerum
natura (the language of which is closely imitated) but before
Vergil, whose many resemblances of diction to Aetna Alzinger
considers to prove that he had read our poem and borrowed
consciously from it. Alzinger’s list of parallels‚ drawn from
Lucretius and Vergil, are of very great value, though as regards
Vergil, many will reject his conclusion; he is not so happy
in restoring the text.

It is with a very mixed feeling that I speak of Sudhaus'
edition· (1898). In sulness of scientific illustrations, drawn
equally from ancient and modern authorities, it far surpasses
any of its predecessors; and its author's main contenti0n‚ that
the poet’s chief source was Poseidonius, though of course in-
capable of proof-for Seneca's Natural Questz'ons are enough
to show how vast an array of scientific writings we have to
deplore as irrecoverably lost—is ensorced with an assiduity,
not to say pertinacity, which commands respect and might
almost seem convincing. Moreover, the work is written
throughout con amore, and displays an enthusiasm not un-
worthy of the poet himself, even where the meaning of the

1899, sides with the pro-Gyraldinians against Alzinger.
