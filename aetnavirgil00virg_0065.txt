THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA’

tated whether to follow C or Relzd„ e. g. in 51 1, 512, where
C gives fauilla Flumina proprietate simul concrescere : Relzd.
and Arund. have fauillam Plurima. Both C and Rclzd. are
in this instance corrupt ε for neither fauilla nor fauillam can
well be right: but the over-frequent repetition of the word
flumen in this part of the poem *is rather against C, while
plurima would form an intelligible antithesis to materiam
aliam: the mass of the stone to the smaller and liquefying
portion.

During my stay in Rome in 1887 Ι examined several of
these late copies of Aetna, all of them more or less inter-
polated. But it must be considered very unfortunate that
the codex of the later fourteenth or early fifteenth century,
which I discovered in the Corsini palace, and which contains
a copy of the Culex¹ of unique importance, has preserved
only the first six verses of Aetna, enough, however, to show
that the archetype srorn which it was intended to be copied
entire was good, and did not belong to the inferior class.
Had we, I will not say the whole, but half of Aetna preserved
to us in this codex, we might have been able to illumine
some of the dark passages where C and S leave us groping.
A MS.. in the Chigi² palace which Ι looked at was dis-
appointing3 not less so one belonging to the Urbino
collection in the Vatican (3 5 3), and another in the Naples
Museum. A somewhat higher importance attaches to one

² This MS. however points to the true reading in 406. It has ubi
congz'tur igni, i.e. cogitur. B‘ahrens, with the rashuess which dis·
tinguished him, ascribed cogitur to the Itali, in other words considered
it a correction os the fifteenth century. The form which it assumes
in the Chigi MS„ congitur, is conclusive against this.
