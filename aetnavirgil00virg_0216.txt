stomach trahat, and prints what all our extant MSS. rightly give,
mallit.

cessante solo, ‘eam dicit soli esse naturam ut, ipso a motu
cessante, rimas meatusque occultos trahat‚’ Struchtmeyer.
Rather perhaps solo is the surface-soil‚ which remains inactive
(cessat) while the inner earth is splitting into channels in every

· direction (Introrsus tralcit undique uenas). It remains a

question whether trahil introrsus should not rather mean, as in
Lucr. iii. 534, ‘draws inwardly to itself’ a number of branching
channels (uenas) with the formation of which the surface-soil
has nothing to do.

178 Non illinc duce me occultas scrutabere causas

Occurrent oculis ipsi cogentque fateri. C.

178 illinc v: illic Relm'.: illi Gyr. 179 ipsae ed. Rub. 1475.

slli (Gyr.) could hardly be dative constructed closely with
(⁴(lllsas, it must be adverb = illic: the form has good autho-

,, rity‚ see rny Noct. Manil. p. 89. The D’Orville ΜΞ.ι of the

Ovidian Sappho has in 125 Illi te inuenio with c added above
by a later hand: and in the Merton MS. (250) of Seneca’s
Natural Quesffions, vi. 7. 5 Quodillz'qzmque tantundem loci teneat
there is no v.l. In itself illi is one of the least suspicious readings
reported from Gyr„ but Ι have not ventured to substitute it sor
illic which Relm'. gives, and to which illinc of δῖ’ points.

Ι marvel that no editor has retained ipsi of MSS. in 179.
lt looks like the antithesis of duce me: as if the poet meant
‘non ego te ducam ut causas illic scruteris occultas: ipsi tibi
sine duce occurrent in oculos’; ‘ I shall not act as your guide
in tracing occult causes there: without any guide you will find
they offer themselves palpably to your scrutiny.’ The sense
is no doubt plainer with ipsae: but the corruption of this to
ipsi is not very probable.

Hinc uasti terrent aditus merguntque profundo
Corrigit hic artus penitus quos exigit ultra
Hinc spissae rupes obstant discordiaque ingens
