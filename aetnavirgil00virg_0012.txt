he carefully avoided. B'ahrens, always free-handed in this
matter, nowhere allowed himself greater licence than in
emending and transposing the verses of Aetna.

A new departure was made in 1882 by Kruczkiewicz' dis-
sertation, Poema de Aetna monte Vergilio auctori praecipue
tribuendum, in which a return was made to the view, mentioned
in the Lzse os Vergil ascribed to Donatus, but now generally
believed to be by Suetonius, that Vergil was the author of the
poem. This was followed in 1884 by Wagler's de Aetna poe-
mate quaestiones criticae: a review of which by Karl Schenkl
will be found in Plzz'lolog. Anzezger, xvi. 117—121.

When, in 1887, I visited Rome with the object of examining
MSS. of the Vergilian opuscula, it was one of my chief aims
to find a new codex of Aetna3 a codex from which C might
be corrected, or the Gyraldinian readings confirmed and esti-
mated in their proper light. Fortune did not befriend me in
this : I could nowhere meet with a MS. which, like the Corsini
MS. of the Culex, could confidently be said to restore at least
one desperate passage. The best of those I saw, Vat. 3272,
was imperfect and often badly interpolated. The poem, how-
ever, was never out of my thoughts, and in the sournal of
Plcz'lolqgry for 1887 began a series of papers continued thence-
forward at intervals up to 1899¹. Ι also delivered three public
lectures upon the poem: 1. ‘A Prose Translation’ (March 11,
1896); 2. ‘The Date of Aetna’ (Nov. 17, 1898); 3. ‘ The MSS.
of Aetna’ (Nov. 16, 1899).

My first recension of the text was printed in Professor
Postgate's Corpus Poetarum Latinorum in 1896. ’

In his volume on the Culex, published in 1887, Richard
Hildebrandt treated many passages of Aetna, and followed up
