COMMENTARY

enough to prove how truly it is always one and the same. But
I would not deny that particular kinds of stone, besides the
molaris, have the property of buming fiercely ε yes, but they do
not liquefy, unless brought in contact with the molaris.

511 fauillae propnetam, ‘by their cinderous property?
Munro shows that this use of proprietas is common in the
younger Seneca. It is frequent also in Pliny’s Natural History
and Vitruvius.

512 simul concrescere = coire et concrescere.

siue, ‘or it may be‚' ‘or perhaps!

513 i. e. quodflagrat, esse sulphur commixtum bz'lumine.

514 robora, sc. cretae, the inner substance of potters' clay.

515 huic fidem, an attestation to this fact: i.e. potters may
be appealed to as vouchers for its occurrence. Liv. xxi. 13. 3
uestra causa me loqui quae loquor uel eafides sit.

517 szssgnum εοηιηιτιηεεσημεῖον κοινόν, a sign which has more
than one application, opposed to proprium, ἴδιον [Sudh.].
Similar is the use of loci communes or proprii, ad Herenn. ii. 6,
arguments which rnay be used alternately by accuser and
accused, or arguments which only an accuser, or an accused can
employ. The constr. is sed lzoc, utpote szgrmcm commune, leue
est nec nisi irrita causa et carens firmamento: ‘this, as a mere
general sign, is of slight weight, and is a trifling argument that
wavers dubiouslyss

519 arguti, ‘ringing,’ as argum aera, Sil. xvii. 18, 1 Cor. xiii. 1
χαλκὸς ἠχῶν. Sudh. Wrongly explains it as ‘ distinct,’ ⁴ expressive '
=‘e’z·np·y0i's·.

aeris et zgm's, MSS.‚ perhaps rightly: ‘sor such as is the
quality of copper and fire, when copper has been sused‚’ i.e. just
as in these, when combined the one to fuse the other, the sub-
stance of the fused metal remains substantially unaltered. But
though this is possible, the poet wishing to emphasize by the
double genitive the combination of the two elements, the fusing
fire and the sused metal, it is more than probable that et {gnis is,
as Scal. thought, a corruption of ab igni.

520, 521 is so written in C:

Curn domitum est constat eademque et robore saluo
Vltraque ut possis aeris cognoscet portam.
