This passage is full of doubts. MSS. agree in expectata ; but
mortis for montis is in C. In itself incendia mortis is possible3
either as=‘ a deadly conflagration ’ or with mortis emphasized
as standing last in the verse ‘a fire that brings death.' The
poet elsewhere speaks of the danger to life from too near an
approach to Aetna when in eruption, 463, 504. Montis, how-
ever, is in the other MSS. and looks right3 I follow Munro.

The stress of 211 lies, I think, on expectata: ‘this is the
reason why the conflagration does not corne unexpectedly3'
i.e. the internal action of the winds is a thing so recurrent
and perpetual, that Aetna may be expected to erupt at any
time ¹. Hac causaexpresses this more directly than Haec
causae which would require an active sense in ruunt, like G. ii.
308 ruit atram Ad caelum pit-ea crassus callgine nubem ‘toss⁷
or ‘whirl up.' Of the various ‘emendations’ based on Gyr.'s
expectanda lerunt none is the least convincing.

212 inflalz's, sc. uentis (209). The distinction between spiritus
(wind in an inflated state), aer, wind in subsidence, is found in
Seneca, N. Q. ii. 1. 3 cum motus terrae spiritu fiant, spiritus

¹ Cic. Caee. ξ 28 testis exspectatus et ad extremum reseruatus might
suggest ‘ long dey‘erredf baffling expectation by prolonged delay.
