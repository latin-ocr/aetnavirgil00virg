thought to outweigh our MSS. of the Verrines‚ the best of
which give futuram (Hertz). It does not seem to me im-
possible that in the passage of Aetna such an archaism
(uenturum = uenturam esse) should have been admitted: but
if there is a full pause after caducae, it is perhaps unlikely that
‚such an archaism would be allowed to add to the obscurities
of an anacoluthic sentence.

whatever the source of Gyr.’s three variants, they are worth
little. (1) What is immo? If it means ‘nay rather,' it must
refer to the objection started in 158, viz. that volcanic effects
are produced near the surface of the soil: to that objection
he has been replying in 162 sqq„ and in immo returns to
the point he has before insisted on, 94 sqq. that the earth
is drilled in every part with cavities (Hild. and Sudh.).
This is somewhat remote and difficult. Matthiae thought
it was imo, constructed, Ι suppose, with terrae, ‘the bottom
of the earth’; on which however he has not been dwelling
in any way particularly. Surely primo of C is on every
showing clearer and simpler ‘to start with’: the porosity of
earth being assumed as a starting-point. As for naturane
it could not stand against C 's naturaque, even if we had the
original MS. of Gyraldus before us; the two words species,
natura are com‘plements of each other, hence que3 the
alternative suggested by ue (the configuration, or if you will
the nature of the ground) is a pedantic affectation of scientific
precision. Thirdly, what is trahat? Hildebrandt makes it
depend on cum from 175, with 177 as apodosis to 175, 176, a
most unlikely asyndeton, and a palpably wrong apodosis. Sud-
haus, making Aelna in 177 nominative to hallas, explains this
as a potential modelled on Greek, and translates, ‘Aetna
might be expected to break into channels.’ But neither agal
in 120, nor concrescant in 281, can be held to support such a
sense of trahat3 and Munro, though accepting immo, could not
