AETN A

(le) posse mouere manu ‚9 Quae incendia tanta putas sustentare
(le posse) nostris opibus ,ἲ the omission of te in both clauses, and
the supplied posse in the second, are both awkward.

These difficulties are considerable enough to suggest a latent
error: if anywhere, in autem. The position of autem in 553
after the third word of the clause is exceptional, for such in-
stances as Hand quotes, Tursellin. i. p. 578, are all drawn from
comedy (Plautus and Terence), those cited from Cicero (p. 579)
are almost all cases of aulem after the second word. Brut. lxxix.
27 5 QVA DE RE AGITVR aulem is an exception which proves the
rule. Still, Lucretius has Et quod inane autemst, i. 10103
Vergil, Aen. vi. 808 Quis procul ille aulem, and ii. 101 Sed quid
ego haec aulem, in which last autem follows the fhurtlz word:
enough, it may be said, to lay any scruple on this point at rest.

Since, however, both Relzd. and Arund. give aurem in 553,
not autem, it is here, Ι repeat, if anywhere, that we should
pause. For the grammatical doubt is rez'nsorced by a MS.
discrepancy.

If sor aulem of C, aurem of Rehd. Ar. we write artem, a subject
is found for both mouere and sustentare, which does no violence
to either clause : ‘ what engines‚ think you, can art bring to bear
by human agency more potent, what fires can it sustain by help
os man’s resources,’ to equal the furnaces of Aetna?

553 mouere Posse: the subject (if aulem is retained) is
omitted, as in Vergil’s Aut uidel aut uidisse putat, vi. 454.
Drager‚ Histor. Synt. ii. p. 414, ed. 1, says this omission is more
frequent with the 3rd person, less common with ist and 2nd.
He quotes de Orat. i. 22. 101 Dum milei liceat negare posse
quod non potero el fizferz' nescire quod nesciam. Fam. ἰν. 13. 6
putabo ad id quod uolumus peruenire posse. Roby, Gr. 1777
cites Cic. Caecil. xii. 38 Putasne possesacere, Rosc. Am. xxii. 61
Aut confitere lzuc ea spe uenisse, and three cases of te omitted
aster scribis. ⁷

555 quantis for tantis os MSS. 1 accept from Ald. 1517 with
all edd. except Sudhaus. tanta . . . quantis=tanta inc. quantae
sunt fornaces quibus Aetna uritur.

556 Vrilur, as in Hor. C. i. 4. 8 dum graues Cyclopum Vul-
canus ardens urit officinas.
