PROLEGOMENA

Whatever suspicion attaches to them, they share in
common with the other excerpts: it is not inconcez'vable
that they were written by modern scholars, but it is far
more likely that they were in the MS. whence Laur. 33. 9
was copied, and from which, presumably, the other, or
most of the other, excerpts came.

Similarly,it would be rash to assert that the right location
of the three verses scrutamur rimas—Quaeritur argenti—-
Torrentur¹ flamma did not also exist in the same codex:
no one can prove that it came into the copy of Pithon
containing the (ivr. variants from some one of the printed
texts of Aetna2‚ or from a note written in manuscript by
some scholar of the sixteenth or seventeenth century. But
the doubt will suggest itself, and finds some confirmation
from the fact that the Esc. extracts give these three verses
(in this order 278—276—277) after 261 (wrongly written
Turpe silent artes m'les inopesque relicte) not after 277.

And this feeling of doubt will assert and re-assert itself
perpetually in every fresh survey of these lections. The
goodness of some, the apparent certainty of a few, amongst
them, at first sway the reader to unhesitating acceptance
of the whole collection. Any weak points which they may
offer he is ready for a time to forget or ignore. Thus, to

take one of the passages which seems to have been known
to Heinsius,

Nosse fidem rebus dubiasque exquirere causas

Sacra peringentem capitique attollere caelum
Scire quot et quae sint magno natalia mundo
Principia

² Torquenlur C.
² e. g. Scaliger's, who has an express note on the point.
