AETNA

hoc Iacobus finxit, tu reuoca ex libris scisso ueluti tecto. atque
hac ipsa scissura tenerascunt uenti quos non posse turbare didi-
cimus nisi angustiis inclusos.’ But the verse is palpably corrupt.
turn for cum jacob. Alzz'nger supporls this by Aen. xi. 828
tum frigida toto Paulatim exsoluit se corpore 377 discedere
Ar. v: descendere Relzd. : discedere uentos Wernsd.: desi-
dere uentis jacob: discedere motis Buecheler.

As a return has lately been made to the text of C, 1 shall first
mention Sudhaus’ interpretation of 375—377. He alters scisso to
spisso ( 37 5), montes (377) into uentos, and adds a comma after
discedere ε otherwise retains C unchanged. 37 5—377 he translates
‘ As under a thick roof it (the congeries) makes the winds
beneath its weight no longer like their former selves‚ but en-
feebled in their course, while the mountain is benumbed in torpid
inaction and one may still retire without danger.'

Buecheler goes a step farther‚ and retains scisso. He supposes
the congeries to form an imperfect and to some extent porous
covering, through which the winds issue sostened (teneros) and
no longer possessed of their native violence (haud similis). He
accepts tum for cum, and suggests molis for montes, i. e. ‘ when
the winds are roused to action.’

Against both critics may be urged

1. That all edd. before them have considered 376 corrupt, and
that this is the impression conveyed by the verse as it stands in
the MSS.

2. That the new interpretation is a lom' desorce, hardly to be
wrung from the words, and wholly unlike the ordinary style of
the poem. similis inust=similss sui ; teneros must =‘ weakly‚’
‘ sostened‚’ of which in regard to winds no instance is cited ; and
the two adjectives must stand in antithesis to each other, with no
particle to express this, i. e. leand similis (sui, sed) inualidos ¹.

Against Sudhaus it may be further argued

1. That he is inconsistent in admitting three corrections of
37 3—377 as given by C, namely luctamine for luctatur or lucta-

² In Lucr. iii. 765 in tenero tenerascere corpore mentem, which Munro
translates ‘ the mind grows weakly in a weakly body‚' the adj. and
the verb explain each other.
