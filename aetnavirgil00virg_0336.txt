AETN A

ztzgz'l is perhaps an early misreading of iugis, and Syrius
ardet (ardens) of Sicanis arx est, ‘and most of all (shall you
see an unequalled marvel) on the ridges where the Sicilian
watch—tower glows.’

For Ι agree with Baehrens in thinking that after the long
digression on Greek curiosities in 567-597, in the course of
which the volcano is left out of sight completely, the verses
in which it is again introduced, and its operations contrasted
with the pigmy works of man, should contain the name of the
mountain, and preferably, with an indication of its being in
Italy or Sicily, not Greece or Asia.

Aetna is called Sicanis in a passage of the Ovidian Ibis, 597,
598 A ut ut Trinacrius salias super ora Gljganlis, Plurima qua
flammas Sicanis Aelmz uomit. In the Linz MS. of the Ibis
the adj. is written lz'ctanz’s, a proof that the word might be
much perverted from its proper form.

602, 603 are thus written in C Rehd. Ar. :

Insequitur miranda tamen sua fabula montem
Nec minus ille pio quamquam sors nobilis ignis.

603 sons sor sors Barth. A duers. xxxii. 16 ignist M unro :
quam sonti Machly: quam qui sons Sauppe: quarn quo sons
Baehrens.

In this distich sons seems certain, zgnz'st very probable. But
quamquam is doubtful. Munro retained it, ‘though its acts
are generally destructive.² This is awkward, especially in the
ordering of the words; Maehly, Haupt, Sauppe, Baehrens,
Sudhaus all reject it. Sauppe's quam qui, i.e. nec minus ille
(mons) nobilis pio igni, quam qui (ignis) sons est, Baehrens'
quam quo, sc. igni sons est mons, are neither of them con-
vincing. On palaeographical grounds it seems more likely
that quamquam represents quam—tam, and that the poet
availed himself of a partially archaic formula like Tam magis—
Quam magis (Aen. vii. 787) which Quintilian, ix. 3. 15, corn-
pares with Catullus’ dum—dum = quoad—usque eo (lxii. 45),
to give the effect of contrast to the pious same which Aetna
on this single occasion won and its ordinary ill-same as a
destroyer. This contrast of Quam—Tam, or Tam—Quam is
found in Vergil, Aen. iv, 188 T am ficti prauique tenax quam
