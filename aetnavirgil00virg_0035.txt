THE DATE OF ‘AETNA'

perhaps the author of the Ciris, was almost certainly the
source from which the others borrowed, no argument of
any real weight can be drawn from a fact which admits
of so many possible explanations.

Approaching then in this tentative way the more remark—
able coincidences of diction accumulated by Alzinger,
and never forgetting that Alzinger himself believes that
Vergil borrowed from Aetna what most critics believe
Aetna to have copied from Vergil, 1 shall attempt to show
that the latter and ordinarily accepted is also the more
likely view.

M ang'festa fides.

Aetn. 177 Aetna sui manifesta fides et proxima uero est.

Aen. ii. 309 Tum uero manifesta fides.

Aen. iii. 375 Auspiciis manifesta fides.

Vergil, like Livy vi. 13, uses the words=‘ a clear proos ³:
the combination, from its use by two writers of such
authority, became stereotyped and the author of Aetna
does not scruple to make a genitive depend on fides.
‘Aetna is a clear voucher of itself,' i. e. of its own workings.
It is doubtful whether this would have been legitimate in
a writer of the best Augustan period.

Aetn. 297 Quae tenuem impellens animam subremigat unda.

Aen. x. 225··7 · Cymodocea

Pone sequens dextra puppim tenet, ipsaque dorso
Eminet ac laeua tacitis subremzjg‘at undis.

Here, again, we can have little doubt that Vergil is the
model, not the copyist. The sea-nymph's right hand holds
the stem, her lest ‘oars her passage through the silent
water ².' The expression is felicitous and exactly describes
