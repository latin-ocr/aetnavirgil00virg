COMMENTARY

metrica13 logically, too, super est seems better than testis ; the
poet enumerating one after another the various places which
confirmed his view· IfI am right in this, it follows that et in
430 should be changed to ex.

In 431 my restoration is accepted by Munro, Baehrens, and
Sudhaus, pingui scatet ubere sulphur ¹. But should this verse be
connected with 430 or with 432? I prefer the former view, ‘the
volcanic district between Cumae and N aples has for many years
ceased to burn, in spite of the sulphur, which is there so
abundant as to be collected for purposes of sale! Daubeny,
p. 317, makes the same remark about the islet of Nisyros. ‘The
sulphur is so abundant as to be collected as an article of com-
merce, and is occasionally exported to Smyrna!

430 locus, the Solfatara, which, as is well known, in the
sixteenth century (Sept. 28, 1538) again became actively volcanic,
and formed the Monte Nuovo (Daubeny‚ p. 208). Its ancient
condition is described by Lucretius, Strabo, and Petronius.
Lucr. vi. 747 Is locus est Cumas aput, acri sulphure montes oppleti
calidis ubificmantsontibus aucti ². Strab. 246 ὑπέρκειται δέ τῆς
πόλεως εὐθὺς ἡ τοῦ (Ηφαίστου ἀγορά, πεδίον περικεκλειμένον διαπύροις
ὀφρύσι καμινώδεις ἐχούσαις ἀναπνοὰς πολλαχοῦ καὶ βρωμὼδεις (Strong
Smelling) ἱκανῶς· τὸ δέ πεδίον θείου πλῆρές ἐστι ‹top-rofi. Petron. S.
120, v. 67 Est locus exciso penitus demersus hiatu Parthenopen
inter magnaeque Dicarchidos arua, ἃς.

433 In cui 7zomensacz'es dedit zpsa rotunda it is difficult to
determine whether rotunda is to be constructed as an epithet
with facies, or as defining nomen, ‘has given the name of the
Round.’ The nominative is found in this latter construction,
even in a clause where an accus. would be expected: so aetas
cm'seclmus aurea nomen, Ov. M. xv, 96. Strab. 157 ὑπάρξαι
πόλεις αὐτόθι τὴν μὲν καλουμένην Ἕλληνες, τὴν δὲ Ἀμφίλοχοι.
(Gildersleeve and Lodge, Lat. Gram. ξ 349).

¹ Val. Flaccus has an imitation, vi. 39 pingui numquam tamen
ubere defit. I do not accept Sudhaus’ modification pingue scatet u.
sulphur as an improvement of my original conj.

²1n Lucr.'s description of the mephitic effluvium Athenaeis in
moenibus which sollows this, 1 think opus of MSS. in 755 Sed natura
loci opus efficit ipsa suapte is a mistake for puS.
