COMMENTARY

a different prefix, of which Pers. S. vi. 66 pone, repone, impone,
oppone is a type. pati nearly = ἐᾶν.

248 manifesta notis, eac'n with its distinguishing sign.

cerata C sor certa is curious: a wax tablet would be such
a cerata sede53 but (1) disponere looks the right word ; (2) it is
a mental, not a mechanical‚ grouping of which the poet speaks.
He means scientific classification‚ and the assignment of things
to genera and species (Le (Herc), notare et separare of ad
Herenn. iv. 2. 3.

250 dominis of C is retained by Munro, ‘for us its lords and
masters,’ but without much real meaning. I follow Schrader,
Haupt, and &Vagler 'in preferring hominis of Rehaz, ‘a human
being’ nearly=‘rnan.’ The idealist of science naturally calls'
on man, the inhabitant of our earth, to examine the nature of the
world he lives in, and take cognizance of its marvels. Omni of
Gyr. agrees with 253-5, but seems veiy doubtful on palaeo-
graphical grounds. ’

251 The first three words of this ν. are uncertain. C and
Rehd. have Et quae nunc m. t. n. n.; Gyr. Quaeque in ea ; the
vv. ll. ascribed to Pithou in MS. D'Orv. x. 1. 6. 6 Et quae tot.
In Postgate’s Corpus Poetarum Latinorum Ι have suggested
Et—quae non m. t. natura ,ἲ-ηοίανε, a sudden appeal which may
be thought inconsonant with the exalted tone of the— poet here.
Yet Gyr.’s Quaeque in ea is far too like a mere correction, and
if Crepresents anything like the true tradition, a not very happy
one. In default of anything better the v. 1. ascribed to Pithon,
Et quae tot, seems possible; cf. Lucr. ii. 1057: this at least
does no violence to the MSS. [Alzinger keeps Et quae nunc,
and supposes an outbreak of Aetna to have happened just
before, perhaps in 49 B.C. On other grounds I consider this to
be impossible]

252 magis for magna is a v. l. ascribed to Pithon, and does
not stand on the tradition of Gyr. alone. Man’s first care is to
ascertain the nature of the earth3 this is nearer to us men than
astronomical speculations. affinis because we are denizens of
earth, and the investigation of its phenomena borders closer
upon us than the knowledge of the stars. Logically this fits in
with the surrounding vv, better than magna.
