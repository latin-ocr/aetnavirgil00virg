AETNA

(cools and) stiffens it discharges a sume, and drawn
onwards by sheer weight rolls along with a mighty
uproar; and whenever it has dashed headlong against
some solid body that rings at its approach, spreads to
and fro the blows of its percussion‚ shining with a
white-hot core at any point where it has been laid
open. At each blow a swarm of sparkles shoot out,
the burning rocks flash fire: away, swift feet, away
with all your speed. For these rocks lose nothing
of their glowing heat in falling: yet, albeit their
furious sweep has ere now crossed the banks of
Symaethus' river, human effort will scarcely avail to
part these banks from their state of fixture with
grappling-irons to help3 often the mass of rock lies
buried for twenty whole days together.

But all in vain I struggle to arrange each successive
point under its assigned cause, if you cling persistently
to a lying fable, and believe that it is a different
substance that turns to liquid fire, that it is from their
cinderous property that lava-floods harden to con-
sistency‚ or if you hold to the belief that what burns
is sulphur mixed with glutinous bitumen3 because,
as they say, when potters’ clay has been burnt in a
surnace its inner substance fuses in the same way, of
which fact potters are an attestation 3 later, as it grows
gradually colder, it returns to its previous hardness
and closes up its pores. But that sign osa common
nature is only trivial, a cause without validity that
wavers dubiously: there is an unmistakable token by
which the truth is established to your conviction.
