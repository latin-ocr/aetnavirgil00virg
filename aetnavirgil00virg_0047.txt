THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

chasms descending sheer into the abyss, the frequent
receivers of cities that have fallen into their bosom, and
burying deep underground a vast mass of ruin. These
spaces are full of air.'

Very noticeable in this passage is the argument from the
analogy of the world we see to the unseen world underground.
This is exactly what our poet enjoins, 145

. Occultamque fidem manifestis abstrahe rebus,

and on which he concludes from the existence of yawning
spaces and far receding caverns in the visible surface of the
earth to similar phenomena below (137 sqq).

Thirdly‚ the poet of Aetna argues from the sudden
emergence and disappearance of rivers to the porous nature
of the ground: for if earth were solid, river-waters would
find no channel. This too is a point which had struck the
attention of Seneca, N. Q. vi. 7. 2 Deinde tot sontes, tot
capita fluminum subitos et ex occulto amnes vomentia. vi. 8. 2
Age, cum uides intermptum Dgrim in medio itinere siccari et
non uniuersum auerti, sed paulatim non adparenlibzcs damnis
minui primum, deinde consumi, quo illum putas abire m'si ias
obscura terrarum, utique cum uideas emergere iterum κον]
minorem eo, qui prior fluxerat?

Other points of close agreement are the contrast which
both writers draw between the sublime works of nature
and the far inferior operations of man.

Aetn. 598 sqq.
Haec uisenda putas terra dubiusque marique.

Artificis naturae ingens opus aspice: nulla
Tu tanta humanae plebis spectacula cernes.

nullum maius est, nosse naturam. neque enim quicquam
