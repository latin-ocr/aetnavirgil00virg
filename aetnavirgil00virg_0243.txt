COMMENTARY

in L but all the fifteenth-century MSS. of Aetna) against
exculto of CS : terrae natura is accepted by Haupt and
Munro. 275 multum of L against multos of C is in-
decisive: if multum would represent mulum, mullos would
equally represent mulos. 277 pallere of L is clear
gain: for all my other MSS. have callere. 278 rumpi
looks right: or can mundi of C point to fundi? 279
intendat of L is less of an antithesis to nutriat than impediat
of C. illos of C looks wrong3 the word is omitted in the
Xlth-century fragment of Stavelot (S). 280 Vnde repenle
of C is undoubtedly right, cf. Lucr. vi. 667 Vnde repente queat
tellus concussa moueri, 1090 unde repenle fllertz'seram possit
cladem conflare (Alzinger). Again pax sit is what we should
expect, pax est of L would be grammatically awkward. 281
C’s animi ‘the sury' of the winds is more effective than the
tame anime of L, which could only be a variation of uenti.
Uncertainty of meaning makes it difficult to decide between
porta, forte. 283 tenues of L is very likely to be the
original of which neue (C) is the truncated remnant. 284
&Vhether surgens (L) or surgit (C j is right cannot be settled in
the uncertainty os 285. But infessa est of L, whether it repre·
sents insessa est, a word of Livy and Statius, or infesta est
(Baehrens), is a weak anticipation of obnoxiam whereas infestus
of C is an easy error for infestis: to which obnoxia is the proper
correlative. uentis of L is a pure gain, uitis a bad corrup-
tion which is found not only in C, but in Relm'. and Arundel.

We have then in L two readings which are certain, pallere
uentis-3 five which are more than probable‚ illae occulto rumpi
tgnes tenues.

In C unde repenle, animi, seem certain3 qua uisum est
carius, lcae rerum maxima, impediat, infestus (infestat), pax
sit, more than probable.

The other points of disagreement are so dubious as not to
affect the argument.

The balance is thus very even.
271 The difficulty of this verse lies in the want of a verb to

auidi, and in the vagueness of istis, for which Gyr. and L
give illis corrected to ipsis. Munro writes, ‘They are ever
