COMMENTARY

woods, which he introduces (though only as a simile) in
362—364.

385 calls sor little alteration: quid, for which Reled. and Ar.
give quod, is perhaps quot, whether referring to flammas or
alimenta ; Munro’s nutriet for nutriat seems almost necessary:
the subj. can hardly be defended as attracted into the mood of
the final clause uacent: ‘let Aetna’s woods pour their teeming
supply of combustibles, everything that as fuel is to call up the
diverse flames Aetna feeds.'

386 ‘illis causis depends on utile, a kind of earth serving,
when in contact with fire, as a means for producing these
effects,’ Munro. Such anastrophe is common enough in Latin
poetry. But here it seems more natural to construet illis causis
as datives in immediate dependence on Μαίενίιι est3 these
causes (i.e. the causes which produce these fires) have materials
of home growth.

uernacula=domestica. Varro, R. R. iii. 5, 7, opposes birds not
indigenous to Italy (aduenae) like swallows and cranes, to
uemmculae, such as hens and pigeons (Le clerc).

387 adpositumque with igni, in proximity to fire 3 or, perhaps,

here with dative. Chenu seems to take this vieW, ⁴ une sorte

genus terrae, from its ordinary use in Pliny and Vitruvius,
can only mean a kind os earth. The poet must be following
special information. Vitruv. ii. 6. 1 speaks of the hot earths
(terraefi’ruenles) of Vesuvius and the Baian region.

388 sulphuris: Freeman, Hz'st. of Sicily, i. 528; Plin. xxxv.
177 neque alia res facilius accenditur, quo adparet ignium uim
magnam ei inesse. Sir Edward Fry, Studies by the VVay, 273
(Nisbet, 1900), states that Etna itself contains only a small
amount of sulphur: ‘One is apt to fancy that there is some
connection between the sulphur of Sicily and the presence of
Mount Etna3 but this, I believe, is quite erroneous. It is true
that sulphur occurs in small quantities on the mountain3 but
