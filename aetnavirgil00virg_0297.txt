COMMEMTARY

Propertius iii. 11. 463 Luc. v. 1183 and several times in Sil.
Italicus and Martial: so too Stat. Theb. vi. 551. (Ramsay,
Alanual of Latin Prosody, pp. 273—277. Add Gratt. Cyneg. 142.)

Munro’s domz'tast stantis sounds to me very harsh3 if any
change be needed, 1 should prefer domita .· at stantis. stanti C
Reha’. and so Sudhaus,=‘part is firm strength (robora) for a
standing fight! With the genitive, robora (sc. sunt) nearly
=‘is a sturdy standing fight,’ i.e. is the semblance of such a
fight: logically this is better.

470 recipit admits the approach of the flames. Ov. F. v. 403
recepta . . . toto corpore pestis erat; M. xi. 416 intima frzgus
ossa receperunt. So reczssere ferrum of a gladiator taking his
death.

hinc indefessus anhelat for hinc defensus a. of C was suggested
by the present writer in 1887, J. (gf Plzz'lol. p. 308, and Ι find
the same conj. in Sudhaus] ed. of 1898. indefissus (sc. hostis),
the fire.

471 aperit se comes into clear view, as in Aen. vii. 448 Tanta-
que se facies aperit, or possibly ‘opening out,’ as Quintilian i.
prooem. 3 speaks of his subject opening· out more widely, latius
se aperiente materia.

spim’tus is explained by Sudh. and Birt as ‘ gas-hauch,’ its
usual sense in this poem. The combination with decrescit
would better suit its more common use, ⁴ high spirit,' ‘fierceness,’
‘ vehemence ἐ so crescit licentia spiritus, Sen. de Ira, ii. 21. 3.

[Ι cannot agree with Sudh. in referring indefessus to spiritus,
as if aperit se hostis could be quasi-parenthetical‚ expressing
the result on the lava (produced by the intensity of the spiritus),
cgf opening its peres: nor with Birt, who conj. donec defessus
for lzz'nc defensus of C .]

472 laeto, ‘ triumphant.’

tropaeo. Trophies were sometimes constructed of stone: this
may have determined the choice of the word.

473 castra sub ipsa: some of the rocks ejected lie close to
the crater: this would represent castra sub ipsa.

474 sqq. After a simile (469—472) which certainly gives but
a poor impression of his powers, the poet again returns to the
prose of actual fact, and describes the look of the lava-stone
