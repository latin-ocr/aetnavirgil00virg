natural, but between qui and quod (which Haupt suggested
for con- of CS 3 cf. quod euntibus = coeuntibus in the Gembloux
MS. of Manil. ii. 380, quod ἱππεία = com'uncla in the Madrid
MS. of Manil. ii. 197, and so Alzinger) it is not easy to choose.
In the rest of its divergences Gyr. if truly reported is inferior
to CS, for (1) defit is only less questionable than fft, confit,
and seems, after the Eclogues‚ gradually to have fallen out of
classical poetry3 desint of CS points to desit (so Alzinger).
(2) erranteis is suspiciously like the false archaisms introduced
by the scholars of the sixteenth century, notably in the ed. pr.
of Velleius. (3) limite is not the sense required, but limine
the threshold at which the winds issue. (4) tradant or tradunt
is an obvious error and makes darkness in a passage which
our MSS. give intelligibly. Even VVagler (a decided adherent
of Gyr.) calls limile tradunt ‘ineptum ac reiectaneum.’

The result of this examination is to throw doubt on quiteneat,
and to be less confident as to acuatque. Unger thought
angralque was the word3 it is at least true that from acuatque
to aquasque is not a very easy step.

Gyr.

The case here is very different: Gyr. presents a total in-
telligible (to say the least) throughout, except estin 170, which
all modern editors except Hildebrandt ¹ drop.

¹ Hildebrandt writes it thus (p. 102) :—
Angustis opus est turbanti faucibus (illo
Feruet opus) densaque premit premiturque ruina;
Nunc euri boreaeque notus, nunc huius uterque est,
‘at one time Notus is in the power of Eurus and Boreas, at another
each of these latter⁴is in the power os Notus.' This seems to me im-
probable : notus is required as the subject ofprenn't.
