PROLEGOMENA

fire can do nothing: by itself it is almost powerless, in spite of
its natural velocity and ceaseless motion ; it is only when rein-
forced by spiri! that it can be brought to act.

(218—221) Ι shall now proceed to inquire where the wind that
feeds the flame comes from, and why its fury subsides and sinks
into absolute inaction.

(222—271) Dzjgy'ession on the grandem· of pleysical reseas-ch.
The highest pleasure of the human soul is to search into the
causes of things. What is the origin of the universe, what is
the nature of its framework? Will it pass into extinction‚ or go
on for ever? By what degrees is the moon’s orbit less than the
sun's? What stars have a fixed circuit, what are the alternations
of the zodiacal signs? What makes the sun pale, the moon
redden ? What do the stars teach us? How do they severally
regulate our lives, whether on land or sea?

(250—271) Such lofty speculations should be our chief end
and aim, as indeed they are our highest and most divine pleasure.
Nor should we sorget meanwhile the earth, which has even
an earlier claim on our attention, and teems with marvels
of its own. Folly it were indeed to explore the sky and the
stars‚ yet indolently neglect the no less grand spectacle that
lies before us and at our feet. But what is the fact? Man
does indeed busy himself with the earth about him, but only to
wear himself out with trifiing cares and sordid details, the
one purpose of which is to accumulate gain. To trace a vein of
gold or silver in the mine3 to torture the soil in order that it
may yield the very most it can ; to examine with the minutest
care whether it will bear corn, or vines, or olives, or {orest-trees ;
to have overflowing barns, casks distended with must, hay-racks
filled to the brim; such are the ignoble cares which occupy
all our thoughts, and upon which we are content to spend our
misused time. μ

(272—304) Far other are the aspirations of the philosophie
soul. It would fain explore the secret of the earth, understand
each operation of nature, not be overpowered by sear of Aetna's
outbreaks, assert the snpremacy of mind against the fables of
superstition. Why are the winds of Aetna sometimes sunk
into complete reposce, at others roused to exceptional sury?
