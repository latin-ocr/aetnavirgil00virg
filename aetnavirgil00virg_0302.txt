AETNA

faciem, as Ovid has induere uultum figuram sormam faciem.
Faciles, however, is defensible‚ sc. opes, the lava adjusts (or
conforms) to itself the easily assimilating materials that fioat
on it, rock, earth, timber, &c.¹

491 thote qualifies inaequalis. The unevennesses of the
ground cause the lava to expatiate leisurely (perpascitur): as
a flock browse here and there at their will.

492 Ingeminant, neut, as in G. i. 333 ingeminant austri.

stantibus undis might be abl„ as Sudhaus explains, ‘ while the
waves (of lava) rear up,' or as I have translated it, ‘sounds
noisily with up-standing waves' (so also Birt). It is, perhaps,
more probably dat., ‘ calls impatiently to the standing waves,’ sc.
to come 0n; comp. increpitare, Prop. ii. 26. 15, and Lucr.'s hoc
alicui nostrum sic increpet ifisa, iii. 932, where, however, the
accus. ltoc makes a difference.

[Munro‚ reading ingeminat fluctus, translates ‘ “ it dashes with
a loud noise its waves in motion on its waters which are stand-
ing,” i.e. which have stuck in the hollows (491).’ On this view
fluctus must be supplied as accusative after increpat]

493 Sicut cum rapidum curuo mare cernulus aestu of C can
only be retained by isolating cernulus, sc. amnis, ‘dipping for-
ward, as when some violent sea (dips forward) with a cresting
tide '3 cernulum est supplied to mare from cernulus. But Sicut
cum, as 1 suggested in 1892 (sourn. os philol„ p. 231), may
very well be an imitation of Homeric ὡς ὅτε.

cernulus, or a word ending in -us, is found in all the MSS.
But the construction which it necessitates is so harsh and
unusual as to make Jacob’s conj. cernulat more than prob-
able. N ettleship, Contribulions 1⁴0 Latin Lexicograplzy, p. 410,
shows that cernulare, as well as cernuare, was an existing

form.
[Vollmer's turbo sor curuo seems to me wrong: curuo (κῦμα

who has described the eruption os Etna os 132935 he had himself
witnessed it. Rer. Sicul. viii. 2 ‘ Effluebat autem hiatibus illis riuus
igneus uelut metallorum liquentium in fornace, occurrentem tellurem
exurens, in lapides et in minimos calculos ingentia saxa dissoluens.’
