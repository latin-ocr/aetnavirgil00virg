AETN A

lueri is probably right for ficere of MSS.: it is a favourite word
with Vergil, and occurs in Lucr.‚ yet we must not ignore the
fact that Par. and Esc. give uidere, and that uidere, not
tueri, is the reading of almost all MSS. (including the Mar-
cianus and the early Brit. Mus. codex (Harl. 2610) collated
in Anecd. Oxon. i. part 5) in Ov. Met. i. 85, where since
Heinsius introduced tueri from two Medicean MSS. and the
scholia on Prudent. e. Symm. 260 contained in¹ Bodl. Auct. F.
iii. 6, it has ousted uidere.

pecudum with mare, brutishly.

224 effusos in humum. Lucian, Bis accus. 20 πότερα χοίρων
δίκην κάτω νενευκότας ἡδομένους χρὴ βιοῦν.

225 rebus (for rerum) of C is surprising, as it could hardly have
been caused by confusing RERV with REB' or REB·. Since, how-
ever, Par. and Esc. have rerum, though in a slightly altered form
of the v., Principia et rerum uarias exquirere causas, we need
not scruple to prefer it. Yet Lucr. iv. 463 has uiolare fidem
sensibus, and our poet himself, Aetn. 515 figulos lzuic esse
fldem.

226 The MS. tradition is here desperately vitiated, Sacra per
ingentem (al. urgentem, rigentem) capitique attollere caelum.
The correction of Gyr„ which was already in possession os
Heinsius, Ingenium sacrare caputque a. caelo, i. e. to ‘exalt our
mortal to divine' is brilliant and looks as if it must be genuine.
Sudhaus shows that the ‘ consecration of intellect’ is also found
in Seneca, N. Q. iv, praef. 10 ingenium . . . quod consecrare·
malles quam conteri, and after the first two words ingenium
sacrare had changed places, the corruption of the remainder
is natural and explicable.

[As however a doubt still lingers whether sacra may not be
right, cf. Sen. de breuit. uitae 19 Ad haec sacra et sublimia
accedas, sciturus quae materia sit dei, and refer to the mysteries
of the universe, the divine operations of which sky and ether

¹ Auct. F. iii. 6 cites the passage thus, ⁴ Cetera cum prona spectent
animalia terram Os hominis sublime dedit caelumque tueri Iussit et
erectus ad sidera tollere uultus! But Cetera cum prona spectent is

palpably wrong; and this somewhat deti-acts from the authority ofthe
MS. as to tucri.
