COM MENTARY

groping‚ not clearly aimed or expressed statement, in which
it is difficult to make out the exact bearing upon the poet's
argument. Whereas in CS the reasoning is clear, though some
part of it is lost: the hidden powers of air are observable
in the huge landslips and vast cavernous spaces which we
osten see: the mellmd of such working is not traceable: all
we can say is that if one enters such caverns an efflux of
air is percepffible, pointing to some unknown storehouse or
centre.

143. Sudhaus finds a subject to dabunt in the sinus and antra
of 137 sqq. It is at least less hazardous to suppose that
a nominative· existed in the lacuna after 142, whether it was of
one or more vv. or even to elicit it from mam-'festis rebus ; once
it had occurred to me that 144, 145 might have preceded 143
as ordered by the poet :

Tu modo subtiles animo duce percipe curas,
Occultamque fidem manifestis abstrahe rebus:
Argumenta dabunt ignoti uera profundi.

145. abstrahe is not, I think, ‘draw from things seen belief
in the unseen,’ but ‘withdraw’ or ‘abstract' from the visible
workings of nature the hidden principle which you are to accept
as the law of her operations.

Here, as in 128 sqq.‚ the problem is to determine where the

apodosis begins. The prevailing view is that the protasis
extends to lzoc plura, the apodosis beginning with necesse est.
So Munro, changing hoc to ln‘c=et quo plura uenti hic, sub
terra, mouent. So also Sudhaus, explaining: ‘quo liberior et
animosior ignis semper in incluso est, et quo ne uentis quidem
segnior ira est sub terra (quam igni) eoque plura mouent, quo
