COMMENTARY

(palaeographically) than the rest: rolant of Wernsdorf, natant
of Baehrens.

rotant I would explain: wood, cliff, and pieces of soil are
the agents that laum-lc on their course1 these weapons of death,
viZ. the lava-waves that spread destruction where they come,
as surely as the missiles of an invading army.

This leaves qunc to stand by itself with little meaning, ‘ Now
you may see.' The sense is besides obscure.

natant is the word we should look for in a description of the
lava-flood: the substances it absorbs, if able to resist the fire,
swim on its surface3 then haec tela might be hic terra ², in
which hic would answer to Nunc. Alzinger’s objection that
the substances are burnt and therefore cannot swim, is true
of the whole result, but not of any moment during which the
stream is observed: a large mass of rock or a solid piece of
timber is not reduced without some resistance. Brydone, T our,
p. 85, tells a story of the eruption of 1669 which illustrates
solumque. The lava-stream encountered a vineyard planted on
an ancient lava, the crevices of which the liquid poured into,
and filled them up, till by degrees the whole vineyard began to
move off3 it was carried on the surface of the stream to a
considerable distance, and though the greater part of it was
destroyed, some part remained to the time when Brydone
visited Etna (1770) ³.

489 Ipsa seems an error for Ipse (amnis), hardly sor {fisum
(solum). faciles was thought by Kooten to be an error for

¹ Or perhaps ‘whirl round' the various substances which are
absorbed.

² terra is a conj. of Haupt’s.

³ This is told in a more reliable sorrn by Borelli, p. 24, and dated
April 4, 1669 : ‘Peruenerat profluuium illud ex liquida et saxosa materia
usque ad collem cretaceum uinetis undique consitum religiosorum
Societatis Iesu, et postquam undique flumen ignitum collem circum-
iuit, eumque maximo impetu percussit, arietauitque, tandem collem
cum uineto integro transtulit e pristino loco usque ad fundum alienum,
incedebatque uinea cum eius solo ueluti innatando pensilis, quo usque
superueniente altiori profluuio materiae ignitae post paucos dies
denuo a glarea repleta et cooperta tota uinea fuit.‘
