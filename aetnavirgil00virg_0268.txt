AETN A

incense offered on the mountain top. But adoratis which MSS.
give is also possible3 the worship is addressed to the altars
as directly communicating with the gods.

[The passage in Solinus 5. 23 (p. 58, ed. Mommsen) cited
by Jacob and describing a Sicilian sacrifice in which the fire
comes to the altar spontaneously, and the sacrificers, while
banquefflng, are touched by a flame without being burnt, ibi
epulantes adludit flamma quae flexuosis excessibus uagabunda
quem cantzgerz't non adurit nec aliud est quam imago nuntia
peaesectz' rite uoti, can have nothing to do with the sacrifice
on Aetna, for Solinus expressly states that it took place on
the Collis Vulcanius not far from Agrigentum, on the south-
west coast of Sicily (Freemam Hisl. os Sicily, ii. 407), a site
far removed from Aetna.

Distinct from this is the site mentioned by Grattius, Cyneg.
430-460‚ Aelian, H. A. xi. 3. The locale of this latter site is
certainly some part of Aetna, ἐν Α’ίτνῃ τῇ Σικελικῇ (Ael.) ε

Est in Trinacria¹ specus ingens rupe, cauique

Introsum reditus⁷ circum atrae moenia siluae

Alta premunt, ruptique ambustis saucibus amnes,

Vulcano condicta domus. (Grat. 430—432.)
for it is obvious that the words of Grattius correspond to the
Ἡφαίστου τιμᾶται νεώς, καὶ ἔστι περίβολος· καὶ δένδρα ἱερὰ καὶ πῦρ
ἅσβεστόν τε καὶ ἀκοίμητον. But this also cannot refer to the
top of the volcano, sor no such sacred precinct or temple of
Vulcan with attendant dogs is associated with the crater: nor
could animals be dragged repeatedly to such a height to be
cured of ulcerous diseases as Grattius states, 435, 436;

Huc defecta mala uidi pecuaria tabe
Saepe trahi uictosque malo grauiore magistros

Moreover the flame which spontaneously kindles the offering
on the altars is particularly stated by Grattius to come from
a cavernous fissure in the rock and to return again to the same
cavern ε

444 Aduersis specibus ruptoque e pectore montis

Venit ouans Austris et multo flumine flammae
Emicat.
