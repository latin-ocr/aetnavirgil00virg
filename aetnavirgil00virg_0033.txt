ΤῌΕ DATE OF ‘AETNA'

Notice‚ first, the rhetorical cast of the language through-
out. Reduced to prose, the meaning is this: ‘Poets are
not contented with inventing a fictitious under-world in the
bowels of the earth: they pretend to know the secrets of
heaven and invent imaginary amours for the gods. Such
licence is not for me: my poem shall deal with truth only,
with the real phenomena of Aetna, and the true account of
its convulsions.'

To bring into relies this antithesis of earth and heaven,
our poet personifies and apostrophizes earth. Nec tu,
Terra, satis. This is not only an artifice, but an artifice
of the rhetorical schools. Equally artificial is the double
norunt, each time the first word of its clause3 the change
of construction from the direct accusative conz'ugy'a, to the
verbal clauses quotiens peccet Iuppiter and ut fluxerit, the
chiasmus in the words Taurus in Europen, in Laedam
candidus ales. The last three lines are even more markedly
late 3 the variety of the pauses, (1) after the second syllable
of the fifth foot libertas ista: sed omnia-3 (2) after the
trochee in the third foot In uero mihi cura, (3) after
the trochee in the second foot Aestuet Aetna ; would have
been impossible in Catullus, not indeed in isolated speci-
mens, but in consecutive lines. As Mr. Heitland1 says,
it was reserved for Vergil to clear up the problem, painfully
felt in Cicero's hexameters, and only partially solved by
Lucretius and Catullus, how to adapt a metre natural and
easy in the dactylic language of Greece to the beavier and
more spondaic cadences of Latin. But when once the
Eclogues‚ and later the Georgics, had settled that question,
it was not difficult to follow the lead of the master, or even
to invent improvements upon him.
