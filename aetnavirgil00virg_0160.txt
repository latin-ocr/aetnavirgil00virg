but just because this lava-stone (colour is the surest
test of its presence) has nowhere combined its forces,
the fire has died away. Legend tells how Aenaria

now it has long been extinct. Again, there is still
to be seen a place between Neapolis and Cumae,
which many years since ceased to burn, though
sulphur oozes out in unctuous abundance for all
time. Men gather it for sale, so far beyond Aetna
is its full supply. The island, which has been
named from its actual appearance ‘the round,' is
soil which has more than sulphur or bitumen to make
it unctuous: there is a stone, besides, which lends
its help, one that is naturally fitted to produce fire:
yet it is seldom known to discharge smoke‚ and
with equal difficulty glows to beat, when kindled,
because the supply feeds only short-lived flames and

fairly rich soil in its abundance of material: yet it
is not such as to match its strength with Aetna’s
wondrous store. And for all that this very island
would have long since been extinguished‚ were it
