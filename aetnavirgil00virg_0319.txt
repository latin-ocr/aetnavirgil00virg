COMMENTARY

547 te iudice, if you judge for yourself, pronounce on your own
opinion, not taking into consideration what others think.

549 paruis, sc. ignibus.

’ 550 candenti pressosque of C is possibly right: the con·
struction would be agedum, candenti fornace pressosque coerce,
‘confine them (sc. tgnes) in a white—hot kiln, and within close
walls‚· i. e. non ad caelum patentes.

agedum. The use of agedum in Prop. i. 1. 19-21 At uos
deductae quibus est fizllacz'a lunae Et labor in magicis sacra
piare βοαῖς, En agedum dominae mentem conuertite nostrae
approximates to this. ln both passages the word introduces
something harder and requiring an unusual effort.

552 soluit uires, has its strength relaxed: see my note on
Catull. xvii. 24.

553 sqq. are thus written in C:

Quae maiora putas autem tormenta mouere
Posse manu quae tanta putas incendia nostris
Sustentare opibus tantis fornacibus aethna
Vritur ac sacro numquam nec fertilis igni.

553 aurem Relzd. Ar. ς perhaps artem moueri Rehd. Ar.
Sudlz. retains mouere. 555 Sustentare Relm'. ε sustentari
ed. Paris. 1507 tantis Rehd. Ar. : quantis Ald. 1517 556
ac sacro [suspect is corrupt. Perhaps arcano nec Relszm
non ed. Paris. 1507.

We cannot lightly put aside the fact that C gives here two
active infinitives mouere, sustentare for moueri, sustentare of
Restat, the less so that Rehd. itself has the active form in the
second of the two.

The well-known avoidance of elision in long syllables like -ri
by the post-Vergilian poets strongly supports here the tradition
of our best M S.; it might almost be said ‘that sustentare should
be retained at any eost.

It may, however, be objected that (1) in 293 mouere is pro-
bably a mistake for mouerz'3 (2) the form of the sentence, ending
as it does with manu=by artzficial means, cf. manufactus, points
to the passive, which is indefinite and general, rather than to the
active, which introduces a single human agent ; (3) if both mouere
and sustentare are kept Quae aulem maiora tormenta putas
