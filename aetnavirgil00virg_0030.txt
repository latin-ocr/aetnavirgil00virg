PROLEGOMENA

fied by the further mistake as to the Medea of Timomachus‚
which had been even longer in the capital, and must have
been constantly spoken of, with its brother—picture, the
Ajax, as one of two master-works by the same painter.

It was in the autumn of 46 B. C. that Caesar, after cele-
brating his quadruple triumph, and receiving the title of
dictator, dedicated the temple of Venus Genitrix. Allowing,
as is possible, that some little time may have elapsed before
Timomachus' two pictures were moved to their position in
front of the temple (Plin. 35. 26¹), we may fix the date
before which Aetna must have been written at 44 B.C.
But it must be later than the death of Lucretius, imitations
of whose poem are specially numerous. It cannot be
earlier, therefore, than 55 Β. C. Between these two dates
there was a great eruption of Aetna (as the combined
evidence of Vergil, Livy, Petronius proves ²), and shortly
after this eruption Alzinger believes Aetna to have been
written.

Our assigned dates thus range over a period of more
than 100 years, taking 45 (or as Alzinger thinks 49) B.C.
as the earliest limit and 79 A.D.‚ when the fatal eruption
of Vesuvius happened, as the extreme. For that eruption
was by far the greatest exhibition of volcanic forces recorded

¹ Elsewhere (35. 136) he speaks of thern as in aede positas. This
seems due to Pliny's carelessness, and is less probable than the other
account (Sellers, p. 92).

2 Verg. G. i. 471-473. Petron. 122—135 iamque Aetna noratur
Ignibus insolitis et in aethera fulmina mittit. SerV. on G. i. 471 u!
dicit Liuius tanla flamma ante mortem Caesaris Aetna defluxit, ut non
tantum uicinae urbes, sed eliam Rlzegina ciuitas afflaretur. Livy here
seems to make the eruption of Aetna immediately precede the
murder os Caesar in 44: Petronius, on the other hand, places it
before the passage os the Rubicon in 49.
