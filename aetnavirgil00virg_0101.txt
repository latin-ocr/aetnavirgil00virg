ANALYSIS Οἱ* THE POEM

channels inside the earth may be shown from what we see
outside, vast gaps in the ground, landslips in which the soil
parts off and falls in ruin or plunges deep down, again forest-
caverns that sink far into the depths: types all of what happens
where our eyes cannot penetrate.

(146—157) Fire and wind agree in this: their fury is more
violent in proportion as they are more closely pent in, the
farther down their sphere of action, the more resolute their
escape, and the more violent the effects of the struggle.
Rushing on where the encompassing matter is least hard and'
most yielding‚ they force a way to the surface: the straining
and convulsion of the pores thus produced causes earthquakes.

(158—174) It is a wrong inference from the large orifices and
chasms which meet the eye at the sufface, that volcanic
disturbances have their origin there. These disturbances come
from below and are proportioned to the amount of resistance
the winds encounter in the channels through which they pass.
Where the channe] widens, their force is diminished. It is
the pressure of winds one upon another in very narrow
passages which is the condition of their fury, and the cause
of those appalling cracks and convulsive heavings which lay
cities in ruins.

(175-186) Aetna is itself the best proof of the potent causes
which are at work within. It has a world of wonders to strike
the eye: huge sudden abysses, rocks here prnjecting, there
called in, elsewhere crossed and interrupted by masses of stone
in complex groupings, some completely changed by the action
of fire, others imperfectly reduced and still submitted to its
action. '

ν(187-217) If you ask what is the cause that produces the
outbreaks of Aetna as we know them„ Ι appeal to what we see;
to touch we are not permitted‚ the force of the explosion making
it dangerous to come near. Ignited sand is whirled up in
a cloud, burning masses of rock are heavcd skywards, a loud
crash bursts from every part of the mountain, the ground is
strewn in every direction with mass-es of sand and stone. The
agents in all this are wind and air; or, more precisely, spiris,
which is the name for air in a tense sorni. Without this spiris
