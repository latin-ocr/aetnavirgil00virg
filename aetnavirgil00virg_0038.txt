PROLEGOMENA

getica, has only three instances in 540 vv„ plagii, Latii
(24, 18, 38). Manilius 'according to Lachm. Lucr. v. 1006),
the Panegyrist of Piso, and Persius, avoid it 3 a proof that
individual caprice ruled in the matter long after the Augustan
era. Still it is true that this form in -z'i marks the later
period of Latin literature, and that its complete absence
from a poem of more than 640 vv. is slightly against
a silver-age authorship.

2. Of three points of metric increasingly observable in
post-Ovidian poets, (a) one is not found in Aetna, ὃ in
nominatives singular and pres. indic. of verbS. (b) The pause
after a dactyl ending the fourth foot like Ipse suo flueret
Bacchus pede, mellaque lentis 13, Lentitiem plumbi non exuit?
Ipsaque ferri 542, which is exceptional in Vergil, frequent
in Ovid’s Metamm„ not uncommon in Grattius, a marked
rhythm in Petronius, and thenceforward (perhaps with the
exception of Lucan) a favourite metrical form in hexameter
writers, especially val. Flaccus and Statius, is quite ex·
ceptional in Aetna. If I have counted rightly, the average
is 1 in 49 vv. (c) The Vergilian rhythrn Sufficit umorem et
grauidas cum uomere fruges G. ii. 424, in which the first
foot is sels-complete, and the second elided before the third,
did not please the later Augustam poets and was avoided
with care. It occurs, though very rarely, in Aetna, 187, 477.
- These points are rather in favour of an early, possibly an
Augustam, date: and both Ba'hrens and Sudhaus hold this
view.

Such a date would also fall in with the ascription to
Vergil, which Aetna shares with the Culex, Cz'rz's and
ilsorelunffi such an ascription pointing to a time not long
removed from Vergil's death in 19 Β. c.

3. Aetna is known to have been in a state of disturbance
