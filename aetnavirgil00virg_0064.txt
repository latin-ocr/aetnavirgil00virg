PROLEGOMENA

texts in the Middle Age, who by the constant examination
and comparison of the MSS. of particular authors, have
arrived at something like perception of the probable course
by which they become at first slightly, by degrees desperately,
vitiated, know that the progress of this vitiation is variable,
and is influenced by very different accidents. A few in-

In 439 our tenth-century MS. (C) gives Pars tamen

to pronounce whether the correction was made early or was
only introduced when a more scientific knowledge of Latin
had set in. On similar grounds I have once or twice hesi-
