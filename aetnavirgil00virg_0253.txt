COMMENTARY

Innatat albus olor pronoque immobile corpus Dat fluuio et
pedibus¹ tacitas eremigat undas.

298 summota, ‘rudely dislodged.’ The word is used of the
lictor forcing the crowd to move out of the way; Hor. C. ii.
16. 9 neque consularis S ummouet lictor miseros tumultus Mentis.
Munro constructs furens in close connexion with summota,
‘maddened at being dislodged by the torrents of water,’ and
in any case torrentibus looks like a substantive, not a par—
ticiple, and must mean, I think, water; but why should not
the air be described as first furens torrentibus, ‘ raging‘ with
these waters, i.e. with the agitation they produce; then sum-
mota, rudely driven from its place, and so reduced to a state
of conflict? Sudhaus, in view of torrentes auras (291), makes
torrentibus = ‘ hot airs,’ which by reciprocal action drive again
upwards the descending moister (uda) air, appealing to Strato’s
explanation of earthquakes as produced by the alternation of
hot and cold air-strata inside the earth. Against this is (1) that
uda (sc. aura) which Sudh. reads in 290 for una of MSS. is
awkward and improbable, (2) torrentibus (sc. auris) in 298,
though the preceding torrentes auras makes it somewhat easier,
is at best obscure, leaving us to infer from aura itself the abl.
with which torrentibus agrees.

299 commurmurat, mutters with the aura, if we may trust
the tendency of the word to express a noise made by more
than one, ‘ein allgemeines Gemurmel,’ as Georges says, Lex.
s. v. commurmuratio, eg. storks‚ Plin. x. 62. There is, how-
ever, no such notion in Sil. xv, 821 clauso commurmurat ore:
Varro and Cicero use the deponent of muttering with or to
oneself.

300 Credendum est, Cic. Tim. xi. 1 Credendum nimirum est
ueteribus.

302 Baehrens' premant for cremant of MSS„ and my turbam
for turbant of C, are natural and easy corrections. turbam,

‘ crowding,’ a Lucretian use of the word ‘jostling’ The accus.
depends on fugiant.

¹ pedibus here is very like pedibusque which Dempster conjectured
in Claud. Paneg. Manl. Theod. 318, where Birt's MSS. have peni-
iusque.
