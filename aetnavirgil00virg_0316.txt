AETN A

535—540 Quod siquis lapides miratur fusile robur
Cogitet obscuri uerissima dicta libelli
Heraclite tui nihil insuperabile gigni
Omnia quae rerum natura semina iacta
Sed nimium hoc mirum densissima corpora saepe
Et solido uicina tamen compescimus igni. C.
ι 535 lapidis is in Sloane 777 537 Heracliti et ubi Relzd.

Arund. gigni all MSS. : ab igni Scaliger. D’Orv. x. 1. 6. 6
however gives igni as a marginal v. l., and though this variant
is there made to refer to tlte words et ibi (wlziclz follow Hera-
cliti in Pitlzou’s Epigrammata et Poematia Vetera), it may
originally have been a smvz‘vul osa tradition wlticlz made 537
end witlz igni, not gigni 538 After rerum Baehrens added
in. Sudh. alters quae into que e, retaining gigni in 537
539 Affunro added a note os interrogation aster mirum3 and so
Szcdlz. Serninium tlze present editor, Journ. os Plzz‘lol. 1887,
p. 310.

Immense is the gain here from the Cambridge MS. C. It
is not often that a simple word like tui assumes so remarkably
perverted a form as et ubi or et z'bz'3 further, Heraclite has
become Heracliti in Relzd. Arund. In the rest of the passage
C shows nothing materially different from the later MSS.

The words Sed nimium lzoc mirum are prima facie suspect.
There is no trace in C of a question: such a question is not in
the style of the poem3 euphony would require nimir, not nimium ;
it is not going very far to trace in Sed nimium a depravation of
seminium. ‘This is the marvellous stock of all the seeds of
things planted in the realm of nature.’ Then Omnia is an
attraction into the case of quae (Aen. i. 573 Urbem quam statuo
uestra est), and the construction is Omnia quae in rerum natura
semina iacta (sunt), lioc mirum seminimn (eis) esse.

If I arn right in this conjecture, fire must have been men-
tioned before, and gigni represents igni preceded by a lost ab,
as Scaliger thought ¹. Probably the first letter fell out, and

¹ Prof. Bywatcr points out to ine that Bernays, who sent him the
reference to this passage of Aetna as illustrating Heracl. fr. xxvi,
assumed Scaliger's emendation to be right.
