EXCURSUS ΟΝ vv. 6, 7.

In the text 1 have adopted Mnnro's conjecture Ladonis for
Dodona of MSS. It has occurred to me since that the poet
may have written :—
Seu te Cynthos habet seu Delost gratior Hyla
Seu tibi Latona potior,
‘ whether Cynthos holds thee or Hyla is more acceptable than
Delos or loved beyond Latona!
Delos is specially Latanz'an, Georg. iii. 6, Ov. Ib. 477, Callim.
H. Del. passim, as the island in which Latona at last found
relief from her travail-pangs and gave birth to Apollo and
Diana, or, on some accountS, to Apollo alone.
What is more, Apollo is in a special sense associated with
Delos, to the exclusion, comparatively, of his sister, in the
Homeric Hymn to the Delian Ap01103 and the combination
Cynthos, Delos, Latona, has its anticipation in verses 14 sqq.
χαῖρε μάκαιρ’ ὦ Λητοῖ, ἐπεὶ τέκες ἀγλαὰ τέκνα
Ἀπόλλωνά τ’ ἄνακτα καὶ ’Ἄρτεμιν ἰοχέαιραν,
τὴν μὲν ἐν Ὀρτυγίῃ, τὸν δέ κραναῇ ε’νὶ Δήλῳ,
κεκλιμένη πρὸς μακρὸν ὅρος καὶ Κύνθιον ὄχθον.

Or, if we take what looks like the earlier form, 25—27 :
ἧ ὥς σε πρῶτον Λητὼ τέκε χάρμα βροτοῖσι
κλινθεῖσα πρὸς Κίνθος ὅρος κραναῇ ε’νὶ νήσῳ,
Δήλῳ ἐν ἅμφιρύτῃ;

Again, in the last verse of the hymn, Apollo and Leto (with-

out Artemis) are mentioned jointly :

αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν οὐ λήξω ἑκηβόλον Ἀπόλλωνα

ὑμνέων ἀργυρότοξον, ὃν ἠύκομος τέκε Λητώέ
proofs sufficient, if proof be required, to show that our poet
would be following a strictly ancient precedent in this triple
allusion in the verses which sorm the prelude of his poem,
(1) to Delos, as the favourite home of Apollo; (2) to Cynthos,
as the particular place in Delos where Latona bore him ; (3) to
Latona herself, as inseparably associated with both Cynthos
and Delos, and sharing the fondness of the god with each
of thern.
