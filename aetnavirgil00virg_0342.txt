AETNA

conj. sementem, a participle of which 1 have found no instance,
though senet is used by Catuli. iv. 26 ¹.

n
628 manus dulces seems the nearest approach to manduces

of C. The praedae or effects which they were trying to carry
off are dulces, from the over-fondness which could induce their
possessors to linger in defiance of the flames. Most edd. give
dites, which is nearer dicens of the fifteenth-century MSS.

629 dim'lz'cze: Claud. Carm. Min. xvii. 27—30 0 bene naturae
memores, documenta supernae Iustitiae, iuuenum numina, uota
senum .· Qui sprel‘z's opibus medios properastis z'n zsgnes Nil
praeter sanctam tollere canitiem, a passage which looks like an
expansion of our poem. Aelian fr. 2 τοὺς ἑαυτῶν πατέρας ἀρά-
μενοι διὰ μέσης τῆς· φλογὸς ἐκόμισαν, τῶν ἄλλων κτημάτων
καταφρονήσαντες.

630 rapient sor rapies of C, perhaps through ναρίἑί, as constas
seems to have become constat in 520. raperes! Munro.

631 fidenz, by parting off on either side and leaving a clear
space sor the brethren and their load. Con. 43 καὶ τοὺς μὲν
ἄλλους ἡ φλὸξ ἐπικαταλαβοῦσα ἔφθειρεν, αὐτοὺς δέ περιεσχίσθη τὸ
πῦρ, καὶ ὥσπερ νῆσος ἐν τῇ φλογὶ πᾶς ὁ περὶ αὐτοὺς χῶρος ἐγένετο.
De Mundo Vi. 33 πλησίον γὰρ αὐτῶν γενόμενος ὁ τοῦ πυρὸς ποταμὸς
ἐξεσχίσθη, παρέτρεψέ τε τοῦ φλογμοῦ· τὸ μὲν ἔνθα τὸ δ’ ἔνθα, καὶ
ἐτήρησεν ἀβλαβεῖς ἅμα τοῖς γονεῦσι τοὺς νεανίσκους. Similarly
Claudian describes the elements as pledged to save thern,
Senserunt elementa fidem, carm. Minor. xvii. 35 ².

635 Felix illa dies: also in Cir. 27, Laus Pisonis 159, Manil.
v. 569.

636-639 are thus written in C:

e
Dextera saeua tenet leuaque incendia ferunt

Ille per obliquos ignes fratremque triumphans
Tutus uterque pio sub pondere sufficit illa
Et circa geminos auidus sibi temperat ignis.

¹ In Stat. S. iii. 5. 60 Et nunc illa lenc! uacuo qnod sola cnbz'li;
for tenet Ι conjecture senet.

² [Postgate conj. uiam, and thinks the poet had in mind Aeneas’
ssight through receding fires, Aen. ii. 633, Ov. F. iv. 800, Manil.

iv. 23.]
