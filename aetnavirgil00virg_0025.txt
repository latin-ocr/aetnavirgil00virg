THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

THE earliest specific notice of the poem is in the Life of
Vergil (ascribed to Donatus, but now generally believed
to be by Suetonius). After mentioning the Catalept0n‚
Priapia, Epigrams, Dirae, Ciris, Culex, Suetonius adds

without the qualifying de qua *ambzgc'tzm It is also ascribed
to Vergil in the oldest MS. Kk v. 34, in the University
Library of Cambridge, written in the tenth century.

could not be Vergil’s. Yet the ascription to him should
not be entirely overlooked. It proves that at a very early
time it was ranked by some critics as belonging to the
same category with poems either indubitably Augustam,
like the Ciris, or belonging to an even anterior period, like
the Dirae and Catalepton. Kruczkiewicz¹, therefore, who,
on external grounds, as we shall see, has in our own day
re-asserted the Vergilian authorship‚ and Alzinger, who
