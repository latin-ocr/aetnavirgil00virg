COMMENTARY

Serionne 460 curis Relzd. A rund. mimutus Relm’. : mina·
tur Ulitius 461 extemploque Relea’. Before and aster this
verse something seems to be lost ictaque ramis] perhaps actaque
rimis 462 denuntiat Jacob.

A very doubtful passage, in which, however, one point is
fairly clear; there is a contrast between the partially consumed
but still burning lava to be seen outside Aetna at its base (a'rca
latera atque imis radicibus Aetnae), and the fiercer burning and
more potent absorption of other combustibles into itself which
the same lava-stone exhibits within the volcano. It is possible,
therefore, that sacie represents the outward look of the stone,
as seen in the open air, in opposition to the invisible smelting
and fusing which goes on inside.

Scaliger thought restat was wrong, and conj. for it reses (τίς
but though reses might well be applied to a volcano in' a period
of inaction, as Varro uses it of stagnant water (R. R. iii. 17. 8),
Claudian of waves in subsidence (Epigr. 86. 2), the nominative
sing. is rare, and the sudden break in the rhythm improbable.

Munro, retaining facie, wrote the passage:

Non equidem mirum facie, qua cernimus extra,

Si lenitur, opus restat;
paraphrasing thus, ‘the effects of the lapis molaris, when the
fury of the eruption is abated‚ si lenitur (optes), are not so
wonderful in the appearance they present to us outside the
mountain (extra): rather is it, when it is on fire in the crater
(illic) and sets in flames all about it, that its terrors are shown.’

My former conj., as stated above, was a modification of this.
I now consider it improbable.

The variants sorsacz'e in the other MSS„ scute of Rehd„ scate
ofArund., may point to a quite different tradition, possibly to
scaterest. This verb occurs several times in Lucr. e. g. v, 598,
952; vi. 895, 896 sic zgitur per eum possunt erumpere sontem
Et scatere illa foras in stuppam semina, where Munro notes
‘he uses scatere of the seeds offire‚ but they may be said to be
part of the fountain! In our poem we have seen scatet dis-
guised in 431, where it is used of a copious supply of sulphur&

¹ Pliny xxxv. 239 mnumerabiles parui sed naturales scatent ignes
uses scatere with no idea os ssuidity.
