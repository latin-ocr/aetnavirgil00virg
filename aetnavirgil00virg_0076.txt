PROLEGOMENA

We may, however, formulate what Heinsius tells us thus.
When he published his second edition of Claudian (1665),
and even, it would seem, before his second journey to Italy
with Langermann in 1652, he had seen a set of excerpts on
a large section (pars potissima) of Aetna, which in correct-
ness were far superior to the vulgate text. They were
extant in the Medicean Library at Florence, and were taken
from a MS. of great antiquity, no longer to be found, but
presumably the same from which Gyraldus had copied the
poem early in the sixteenth century. Some of thern at
least were in Heinsius' possession, and he has emended
two passages of Aetna from them: but he seems to have
distrusted the accuracy¹ o'f the copy he had seen of these
Florentine excerpts on Claudian, and probably included
those on Aetna in the same condemnation.

All these variants on Aetna, generally known as Gyral-
dz'm'cm because they are believed to have come from the
codex from which Gyraldus copied the poem in full, I shall
now cite from the two reports of t'hern (1) in Acta Socl'etatz's
Latinae lenensis for 1756, Torne v. pp. 3-6 ,· (2) by Matthiae,
Neue Bz'blz'otlzek der schemen lesensclmflen, Tome lix. pp.
311-327. The former I quote as I: the latter as M.
