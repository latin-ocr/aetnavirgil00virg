PROLEGOMENA

What became of the copy of Aetna which Gyraldus made
from this early MS. is unknown. But when Heinsius was
writing his notes on Claudiam (second ed., 1665 ¹) he
was in possession of some very ancient variants in the
text of Aetna, by the help of which he has corrected two
passages from it. On In Ruf. ii. 527 he cites Aetn. 140
thus: Cernis et in silm's spatiosa ‘² cubilia retro Antraque
demersas penitus fodisse latebras ‚- adding, ‘ quomodo uersus
illi ex antiquis membranis legendi.’ Againy on Rapt. Pros.
i. 171 he cites Aetn. 218-2 20 thus : Mmc quoniam in
promptu est operis natura solique Vnde zpsc' uenti, quae res
incendia pascit, Cur subito cohibent uires, quae causa silendi 3
adding, ‘quomodo illi castigandi sunt ex ueteri codice.'
From his preface3 it would seem that the source of these
variants was a codex in the Medicean Library at F lorence,
which ζ schedae Mediceae' contained excerpts not only from
Aetna, but Claudian, both drawn, as Heinsius believed,
from the codex of Gyraldus above mentioned. The actual
and very old codex of Gyraldus had disappeared, and all
the attempts which Heinsius and his friend Langermann

³ Praes. p. 57 ed. Amstelod. 1665. Heinsius, speaking of the Vatican
MS. os Claudian excerpted by Livineius, calls it the best and oldest of
all, except Lucensis ille Gyraldinus, cuius nihil praeter excerpta, atque
illa satis oscitanter descripta, uidimus, quamquam uolumen ipsum,
cum Lucae essemus, ut multa cum sedulitate, sic irrito successu sit in-
uestigatum ct milti et Langermanno nostro, quod in eo extitisse nonnulla
compertum haberem, multo usui sutura, quae ab aliis membranis
mutuari hand possis, quale carmen istud in Aetnam, quod in catalectis
poetarum ueterum adscm'bit‘ur Cornelio Seuero ct cuius partem potis-
simam, uulgatis exemplaribus longe castigatiorem, illic se

obtulisse, tam Gyraldus ipse, quam schedae mediceae fidem indubitatam
faciunt, atque omni cuz-ceptione maiorem.
