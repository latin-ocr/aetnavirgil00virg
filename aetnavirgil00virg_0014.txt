PREFACE

words is obscured by imperfect art in the composer or hopeless
vitiation in the MSS. Nor will any one deny that Sudhaus’
position is throughout that of a perfectly independent explorer,
assured of the truth of his own views, and not afraid of asserting
them boldly and undisguisedly. For the actual restoration of
the text he has made at least one suggestion which most
scholars will consider certain (trecenti, 579), and his discussion
of critical and exegetical difficulties throughout goes hand in
hand with an enlarged scientific perception, such as neither
Jacob nor Munro could claim.

But after all, the value of an edition of a difficult work of
antiquity‚ especially a poetical work, and this transmitted in an
imperfect and often deeply vitiated condition, must ultimately
rest on considerations of a more tangible and palpable kind,
such as the inter-relation of the MSS. which have preserved
it, and the indications of language and metre.

Now, as regards the MSS. of Aetna, Sudhaus starts with
two hypotheses, neither of which is proven: (1) that no weight
is to be given to the fifteenth century codices, even in cases
where, as against C or S, they seem to be right; (2) that the
variants reported as coming from the so-called Gyraldinian
MS. are always to be preferred to those of our earliest and
best actually elevting MSS. (C and S). The latter of these
two hypotheses appears to me indisputably wrong, and if it
is wrong, as Ι hope to have shown in my Prolegomena, any
text of the poem which adopts the whole of these Gyraldinian
variants, must be erroneous and untrustworthy.

When we come to metre‚ what can be said of creber, 107;
sbrtis, tenuis, as nominatives singular, 314, 494; fluuium,
unelided before lmut, 129 ; forte, lengthened before flexere, 289?

Flagrant as these offences against prosody must be thought,
they are surpassed by the boldness, not to say violence, of
Sudhaus' exegesis. Trained to believe that the ‘ Uberlieferung ²
or MS. tradition of the text is to be retained at any eost, he
has not scrupled to elicit from passages obviously corrupt
meanings which, to a sane criticism, they cannot possibly
bear. As examples may be mentioned his defence of eripiantur,
3935 corz'lm‘, 4c6; extra, as abl. fem. of exter, 456; and the
