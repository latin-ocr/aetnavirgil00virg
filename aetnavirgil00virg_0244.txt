AETNA

full of greed, when anything has shown itself more precious
than what they have.' Alzinger supplies sunt, and explains
istis of the grand phenomena of nature mentioned in 253, ‘ They
are greedy only when (sic . . . qua) anywhere something more
precious than the despised marvels of nature has corne into
view,' i.e. something which like gold or other treasures of the
mine pays their search in hard coin. Such an omitted verb
seems intolerably harsh, even in Aetna, with its daring grammar
and free constructions. I find a verb in itis sor istis of C: the
vocative mortales has preceded in 253.

Baehrens, followed by Sudhaus,
Sic auidis semper quaeuis res carior ipsis]

272 ⁴ Each man must play llis own part in taking his fill of
noble crafts': such seems to be the meaning of sibi quisque.
The construction of sibi¹ is determined by quisque, which in its
different cases is naturally combined with the reflexive sibi, se
and by the analogy of combinations like suo sibi telo, suco, sua
sibi ingenua indoles, sua sibi fallacia all Plautine (Holtze,
Syntaxis i. p. 364).

bonis artibus: Sen. N. Q. vi. 32. 1 non enim aliunde uenit
animo robur quam a honis artibus, a contemplatione naturae.
He means the pursuits of culture and education, particularly the
study of science and natural phenomena.
