COMMENTARY

by Livy xl. 22, that the excessive heat of the day is equalled
by the intense cold of the night, caniculae ortu3 such a
violent contrast of heat and cold might form a suitable con-
dition of eruptions. In our own time a violent outbreak of
Etna took place at this very time, July and August, 1892.
Ι quote from the Times of August 17: ‘The whole district was
convulsed with spasmodic throbs and the atmosphere was filled
for miles around with a hot maddening dust that continued to
sall for several hours and wrought great damage among the
vines and other produce. Masses of incandescent rock of
considerable size were ejected to a height of half a mile, and
were accompanied by deafening rumblings and by showers of
volcanic bombs.’ But the most tenrific outbreak in modern
times, that of 1669, was in March (Borelli‚ Historia et Meteo-
rologz'a Incendii Aetnaei, 1670, p. 16); and the table given by
Daubeny‚ p. 290, does not point specially to the Dog—days.

Scaliger suspected a corruption in 601, mainly on account
of ardens, which Rehd. Arund. and other fifteenth-century MSS.
give. C, indeed, has ardet. In spite of this, I agree with
Baehrens in suspecting the accuracy of the manuscript tradition,
whether in C, or Relzcl. and Arunct.

What is uzjgil? It must be connected with cernes, ‘ and most
of all by wakeful observation (i.e. at night) when the Dog-star is
at the height of his gIOW.’ This, it may be said, is right, because
according to Pliny iil 236 ardet Aetna noctibus semper, iii. 88
mons Aetna nocturnis mirus incendiis, the flames of Aetna
were always to be seen at night, and this would be the time
for keeping a close look-out. mgil would thus be = sz' uzgil
fueris, or si aegilanem&

This may serve as an explanation, but does not remove a
certain awkwardness in the construction, and in the juxta-
position of the two adjecffives, zczgz’l, feruens.

¹ Pliny's use of aug-il, in his description of the watch kept about
gold mines to anticipate the collapse of the earth, xxxiii. 72 dat stgnmn
ruina, eamque solus intellegit in cacumine eius montis uigil, suggests
another possibility. Watchmen might be stationed at different points
of Aetna during the dog-days to detect the first signs of a coming
outbreak„ utjgil would thus mean ‘ if you act as a watchman.'
