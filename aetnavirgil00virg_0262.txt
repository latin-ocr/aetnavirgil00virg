AETNA

Inprospectus was, explained by Scal. as ‘ad quarn prospectus
hominum peruenire non potest ' 3 Aeschylus’ ἀπρόσδεικτος πέτρα,
Supp. 794, ‘ even where Aetna opens most unobstructedly beyond
human ken.' VVernsdorf supposed it to mean, the part of the
mountain where the chasm opens so deep down that the eye
cannot reach to the bottom‚ which should rather be indespectus:
as the passage he quotes, Stat. S. i. 1. 88, shows. On either view
Aetna must be masc.

Aetna is always feminine elsewhere: the passage of Solinus
v. 9 cited by Munro as proving it masc. is a very weak voucher.
Eminet montibus Aetna et Eryce, Vulcano Aetna sacer est,
E7yx Veneri, for the word montibus determines sacer, and there
is no other instance in Solinus where it is masc. I venture to
doubt whether it could have been so used by the poet, who avoids
with religious scrupulousness such deviations from Vergil and
the other great poets who preceded him, and who elsewhere
always makes Aetna feminine.

In Schrader's Introspectus we have a nom. to liberrimus at
which Vergil himself could not cavil, formed on the model of
adspectus, conspectus, despectus, prospectus, suspectus, circum-
spectus, ‘a look inside.’ This word was accepted both by
Haupt and Munro, and seems to me unexceptionable. It is not
unlikely that Haupt was also right in preferring Aetnae of Rehd.
Ar. to C’s Aetna: but the abl. is possible ‘ on Aetna.'

340 tantarum semina rerum Lucretiam, as Alzinger shows.

341 flammas is open to doubt as against the poet's use in two
ways, (1) by being in apposition with semina, which is too far
from it, (2) flame is not treated as the most prominent agent
in eruptions, but spiritus, air, under which as magno sub duce fire
performs its subaltern’s duty (militat) 217. Hence I conj.
flammans3 the nom. participle is frequently found with n
omitted‚as shown at length by Corssen (Aussprache, i. 252 sqq.)
from Inscrr. and MSS„ cf. my note on Catull. xxxix. 18.

Huinc igitur credis torrens ut spiritus illi

Qui rupes terramque notat qui fulminat ignes
Cum rexit uires et preceps flexit habenas,
Praesertim ipsa suo decliuia pondere numquam
