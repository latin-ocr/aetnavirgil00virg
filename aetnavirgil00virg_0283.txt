COMMENTARY

tius has saepta domorum (walls), i. 489, vi. 228, and so VitruV.
viii. 3. 10 efficiunt lzis crustis in agris saepta.

409 Sudhaus retains tutum est, interpreting ‘the fire has its
safe place, and the conquered is content to submit‚' i. e. the
lava-stone succumbs to the flame and owns itself defeated. This
distracts illi from uicto, and is not even the natural sense of
the words as Sudhaus arranges them, which, if genuine, should
mean ‘it finds a safety in the proverb “endurance sor the
conquered.’'' That the poet so wrote 1 cannot bring myself
to believe.

Munro's ut lum, an exclamation in the style of Varro's Quod
aiunt non esse analogiam, ul in hoc errant! L. L. ix. 34, or
Catullus’ Sallus . . . nonsalso diues Fertur, qui quot res in se
habet qgrregz'as! (but other MSS. give tot) necessitates some
change in fide: he edits thus

non tutior hausti
Vlla domus; seruans aciem duramque tenaci
Saepta fidest3 ut turn est illi patientia uicto!
in which saepta is of course nom. fem. (so also Sudh.), ‘fenced
about with resolute fidelity.’

The passage must remain doubtful: my conj. bruta, ‘insen-
sate,' ‘apathetic,’ would be Lucretian, vi. 105 bruto pondere.
Lucretian certainly is redit in uires, iii. 505 redit in sensus.
Or possibly lutum may be sic lum or sua lum, ‘such is its
submissiveness when once defeated,' or ‘once defeated it shows
a submissiveness peculiarly its own.’

41 1 cardo of C can hardly be tarde, as cunctanter and ngrre in
413 would convey the same idea ad nauseam. Ι believe it is
an error for carbo, A mass of lapis molaris might be so called
as a carbonized or rather carbonizing substance, of course in
reference to its slow and gradual burning (soum. (gf Pln'lol.
1895, p· 17)-

410 sqq. The fire smoulders on within the lava-stone, and
does not at once discharge itself in flame: in this respect it is
unlike other stones in which the germ of fire soon dies out and
is then extinct: lava retains its fire and takes a long time and
many burnings before it is reduced to its final state of pumice-
like cinderiness or crumbling sand.
