AETN A

Le Clerc kept this unaltered, thus :
Terra foraminibus uires trahit, urget in artum,
Spiritus incendi uiuit per maxima saxa,
making Terra subject to both trahit, urget: then Spiritus
ιἠαήῑίίει incendium cum flatu coniunctum? uiuit, ‘lives‚' i. e.
shows itself a living force in its effect on the largest rocks.

Sudhaus also joins Spiritus incendi, which he makes nomin.
to unget i. a.; uiuit per maxima saxa, sc. Aetna, which lives
through the mighty rocks that seed its glow.

Of these, I prefer Le Clerc’s view, as on the whole less
violent: but find it hard to believe either in so harsh an asyn-
deton as trahit, urget, or so unexampled a combination as
spiritus incendi.

Scaliger thought uiuit corrupt and conj. cuiuis3 Munro uis
it: Baehrens m'afit. This seems unobjectionable, and nothing
so good has been suggested since.

567 laudes is not likely to be an error for aedes with templa
immediately following. lt may be explained as ‘glories,’
i.e. monuments which have become famous in the world
for their magnificence. Verg. G. ii. 174 res antiquae laudis
et artis.

operosa with Dim‘lz'is hominum, ‘elaborate with human wealth,’
i.e. built with all the lavish resources of wealth. Munro cites
Ov. M. Χν. 666 proceres ad templa petiti Conueniunt operosa dei:
and so Ov. Her. iii. 31 Viginti fuluos operoso ex aere lebetas. Cf.
Tac. Hist. iii. 32 grauia auro templorum dona.

568 arcas is my conj. for sacras of C: coffins e. g. of Osiris or
Alexander the Great or Darius (Theophr. de Lapid. i. 6,
p. 36, ed. Wimmer): or chests like Cypselus’ cedar chest‚
covered with ivory and gold figures and scenes from mythology
(Paus. v. 17 sqq), which was shown at Olympia3 the chest of
Adrastus, exhibited at Sicyon, in qua quid sit {queratur Ampel.
Lib. Memorialis viii. Buecheler conj. siquast, with which
uetustas (nom. fem.) would agree: memorare will then be like
uisere dependent on Currimus. Travellers not only visit and
see, but write accounts of the wonders they have seen abroad.

569 maria de Rooy convincingly for materia: similarly C has
praecept-1& sor praeceps in 67. terris MSS„ terras de Rooy.
