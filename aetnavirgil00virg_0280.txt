395 Ac suggests, but can hardly be, ‘ aS‚’ a sense in which it
is sometimes found without a word of comparison (aeque, tant-
opere, ἃς.) before it, e.g. Plaut. Bacch. iii. 6. 20 quem esse amicum
ratus sum alque ipsus sum milti. Cic. Fam. xii. 13. 1 neque

Dauheny, Volcanos, p. 83, gives the following explanation,
speaking of the Eifel : ‘The lava is divided by vertical fissures
into irregular columnar masses, some twenty feet in height, and
these columns cut horizontally‚ and having their angles rounded
off, are fashioned into mill-stones, for which they are well
zidapted from the unevenness of their fracture, derived frorn the
infinite number of minute cells distributed through the substance
of the rocks In modern times, one species of trachyte stone,
distinguished for its hardness and cellularity, and therefore
much used sor mill—stones, is known as mill-stone trachyte
(Daubeny, p. 121).
