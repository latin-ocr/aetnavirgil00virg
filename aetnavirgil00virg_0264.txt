AETNA

and repose? 11· in excitement it whirls up masses os rock and
discharges fire with a detonating roar, may it not, in subsidence,
be strong enough sometimes to dislodge portions of rock,
availing itself of the natural tendency of rocks to fall in?’
Analyzed, the words would = ‘Huic igitur sic credis ut neges
spiritum cum rexit uires, posse corpora materiae deripere et ab
rupium arcu absoluere ? ’ Or, Huicne credis ut numquam diri-
piat may=‘Can you believe, on the showing of this, the
impassibility of the spiritus, when in a milder form, tearing
down masses of rock? Cf. the use of ut after uerisimile non
est in Verr. iv. 6. 11 Verisimile non est ut ille anteponeret.

illi of MSS. may be a mistake for ille (Scal.)‚ but is more
probably a dative, sc. Aetnae. Such a dat. would be Lucretian,
and so perhaps ruinis Impetus, 347 ¹. Walter observes that
spiritus illi is also in Aen. V. 648.

fornicibus solum, id est cauernosum’3 and so Munro‚ ‘tear
down the cauernae.’ Sudh. makes ualido arcu the strong
curve of the crater; but it may be doubted whether this would
have been expressed in words which so little suggest such
a meaning.

347-349‚ owingto the obvious corruption of 349, are very
obscure. Munro's view that a verse is lost after 349 is im-
probable, for that verse has every appearance of being the
conclusion osan argument. Metrically it is very like 337, which
also is complete in itself. It is equally improbable that tantus,
adtentos, tantos should follow each other in three sequent verses.
