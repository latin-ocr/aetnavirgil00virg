THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA'

the brilliancy of Gyrsss correction
Ingenium sacrare¹ caputque attollere caelo

obscures the fact that Gyr. also gives satalia, a v. l. which
is manifestly wrong.

It may be argued, that as all the Gyr. variants profess
to have V attached to them, they all stand on the same
footing, and are all drawn from an ancient source. But
(1) neither the Iena editor nor Matthiae are explicit on this
point, (2) even if they were, we cannot be sure of the
exactitude with which they have been transmitted, from
their earliest appearance in the cod. uetustzksimus, to copyists
of the fifteenth century, thence to transcribers like Gyraldus
in the sixteenth, or excerptors like Ernst in the seventeenth.
Pithou's Engrammata et Poematia uetera, in a copy of
which the Gyr. excerpts were written, is not earlier than
1590 3 if the cod. uetust. was really of the eighth century,
an interval of 800 years elapsed between the fam primus
and the earliest date at which they could have been copied
into Pithou. If Ernst2 himself copied them into Pithon,
this date will be removed to forty or fifty years later 5 and
if they are a copy from an original supplied by Ernst, this
will bring them later still. As we actually know thern, they
*are transmitted from the middle and end of the eighteenth
century.

The conclusion then to which our inquiry has brought
uS, is that the Gyr. variants cannot be accepted unreservedly
as ancient or genuine, that such of them as, by general
consent, are of commanding excellence, must not blind
