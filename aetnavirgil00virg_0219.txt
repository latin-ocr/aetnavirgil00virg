COMMENTARY

The two next vv. (188, 189) are a battle-ground of criticism.
The text of Cand our other extant MSS. cannot be interpreted
as it stands, and has not at present been certainly corrected.
Gyr„ on the other hand, as explained by Damste', Mnemos. xvii.
196, is intelligible as it is reported: or again with Haupt's slight
change of signes for signis. On the former vieW, signis Mille
stand emphatically at the beginning of the new clause, enforcing
non illam p. aut l. discrimine (Damste). On the latter signes
is constructed with paruo aut t. discrimine; as Haupt explains
‘ ne exigua indicia quaeras ut illam causam intellegas ε magna tibi
certorum argumentorum copia sponte occurret,’ Opusc. i. 45.

In this instance it is almost impossible to readjust C so as
to fit into Gyr. The genitive parui aut tenuis discriminis
shows no variation that might make it seem a rifizccz'meulo
of Gyr„ as eg. if one of the adjectives were in the abl.:
ponentibus of C finds a natural explanation in ponent ibi of
S, or ponent libi of Κρῆτάς all these are stubbornly remote
from uenient tibi of Gyr. Equalsy wide is the gulf which sepa-
rates sub exiguo tempora uera of C and the fifteenth century
MSS. from sub exiguum pignora tempus of G yr. Most modern
critics therefore accept Gyr. unconditionally, Jacob, Haupt,
Baehrens, &Vagless Sudhaus. Damste shows that signis is sup-
ported by 448,ngnera by 40‚135, 459, 518. Alzinger's objection
to sub exiguum tempus is not convincing, see Drager i. 619.

Munro retains C's reading, with these changes :'

Non illam parui aut tenuis discriminis: ignes

Mille sub exiguo ponent tibi tempore ueram,
sc. causam. But here it is hard to see why sires should be
appealed to as the cause of fires. In the Journal ofPhilolqgry for
1895, p. 10, it was suggested that ignes is an error for ingens 3
for the words Non illam parui aut lenuis discriminis imply
an antithesis; such an antithesis would be supplied by ingens,
sc. σαπείη this also gives a motive sor Mille: ‘a cause indeed
which is not of small or slight significance3 it is overpowering‚
and will set (ponet) before you a thousand facts (uera) in a brief
moment of time) ingens has become ignes in the excellent
Merton MS. (250) of Seneca's Natural Questions i. 6. 1 et bibit
ingens Arcus (G. i. 380).
