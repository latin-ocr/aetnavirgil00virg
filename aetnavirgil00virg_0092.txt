PROLEGOMENA

superest (2) on 429. I take the two as mutually explaining
each other: that is to say, the reading of the MS. from which
Pithou drew the v.l. of 429 as I have copied it from D'Orv. was
in some way confused, particularly in -cta of tincta being
separated from tin· ; and superest was written in the margin of
the line before (428). This appears to me a strong confirmation
of my conjecture in vol. ii. of the Corpus now editing by
Prof. Postgate Νῑιηζ exlz‘ncsa [diu] superestque Neapolz'n inter.
Another conj. of mine uncis (507), published in the Journal (ff

th'lology for 1887 p. 309, nearly coincides with unco of D'Orv.‚
where MSS. give iunctis.

464 Et tuto speculaberis omnia collis. C.

e luto Scaliger and so D’Orv.

475 Asperior sopitaes et quaedam sordida faex est. C.

Scobz’s iis seems to be new, but is not a good correction.

486 Quippe nihil reuocat curtis nihil ignibus obstat. C.

curuis (D'Orv.) is a correction made independently by D'Orville
himself, and also by Munro.

518 Quae tripidat certe uerum tibi pignore constat. C.

D'Orv. has uerum cerlo sibi, wrongly, but sibi looks like
a corruption of the genuine reading tibi, which is only to be
found in C (a MS. of which Pithou had no knowledge), and
cerlo is undoubtedly right. Whence did Pithou draw cerlo and
sibi? cerlo is in Scal., but Pithou may have got it from a MS„

since it is found in Sloan. 7773 or both cerlo and sibi were
conjectures by Pithou himself.

585 Tu quoque Athenarum carmen tam nobile sidus

Erigone sedes uestra est philomella canoris
Euocat in siluis. C.

D’Orv. has here three notes, crimen for carmen, an old emen·
dation3 uestras for uestra en which is printed in Pithou's text
(1590), Deuacel sor Euocal. Little is to be got, 1 think, from
either (Ι) or (3); but (2) is suggestive.
