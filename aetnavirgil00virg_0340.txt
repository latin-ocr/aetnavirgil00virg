AETNA

tagla belli Dz‘rccfugcznt‚ ‘they drive off! There also fugiunt
might have been expected. In 615 Collzgz't ille arma, the
Catinaeans <if this is the urbs) gather up their arms to resist
the flames which have surprised them;fugasse continues the
idea: they not only resist‚ but think they have routed their
enemy. ratis abl. abs. praemia: Varro connects praemium
with praeda, L. L. V. 178 Praemium a praeda, quod ob recte
quidsacsum cmzcessum; and the idea of booty is often felt in
the word. Aen. xi. 78, 79 Multaque praeterea Laurentis prae-
mia pugnae Aggerat el longo praedam iubes ordine duci. So
here it is used for the effects which the Catinaeans had secured
and succeeded in carrying off with them.

622 Concremat: a good word used by Livy, xxxviii. 23 armis
hostium in mlo concrematis cumulo, though there it is the
various arms that are burnt in*one fire together3 in the verse
of Aetna the men (caplis) are burnt wille their effecte.

pascunt, νέμονται, spread. In this sense the passive is more
usual. Ov. M. ix. 202 pulmonibus errat Ignis edax z’mz's perque
omnes pascitur arlzt53 and so Aen. ii. 684 circum tempora pasci.

623 pleis. Some will prefer the older emendation, deis. It
is true the Catinaean brothers were specially called Piens, and
the ground where they shouldered and so rescued their parents
was known as Εὐσεβῶν χῶρος. Lycurg. c. Leocr. 983 Aristot.
περὶ θαυμασίων ἀκουσμάτων, 154 = de Mundo vi; Pseud. Aristot.
de Mundo, vi. 33 ; Strab. 2693 Conon 43 ; Val. Max. v. 4, Ext. 43
Sen. de Benef. iii. 37, vi. 36; Sil. It. xiv· 197; Mart. vii. 24. 53
Aelian fr. 2 (Hercher); Paus. x. 28. 4; Philostr. Vit. Apollon.
v. 173 Auson. 295. 2 3 Claudian. Carm. Minor. xvii.

But this does not prove that piis or pleis could be corrupted
into dees. As it is, we find the word repeated four times in
thirteen lines: pietas, 632; pios, 6333 pso, 6383 psoram, 644.
deis would mean not that the two brothers were deified, which
the words of Claudiam, Carm. Min. xvii. 41, 42 Cur non Amphi-
nomo, cur non tibi, fortis A napi, Aeternum Siculus templa
dicauit lmnesl? seem to disprove‚ but that the influence of

¹ Yet iuuenum numina in verse 28 of the same poem poInts to
something like divine honours.
