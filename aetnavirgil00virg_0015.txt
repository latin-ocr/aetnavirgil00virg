If philological criticism may be regarded as a delicate plant
which it has taken centuries to nurture into perfectiori, we seem
to have arrived at a period full of danger to its growth, or even
continuance. At the beginning of the twentieth century we are
asked to accept as possible, Latin which from the sixteenth
century onwards would have been either called in question as
suspicions, or corrected as indubitably corrupt. From age to
age, the progress of philological science has been hitherto
marked, partly by more exact examination and appraisal of
MSS„ partly by increased skill in eliciting from the manuscript
tradition some restoration not violently in conflict with the
probabilities of language or metre. Such nice adjustment of
the two main bases of criticism, Palaeography and Conjecture,
has in different degrees distinguished all the most eminent
philologists, Vettori‚ Turnebe, Scaliger, Heinsius (sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries)‚ Bentley (eighteenth)‚ Lachmann, Haupt,
Madvig, Ritsch1‚ Munro, Palmer (nineteenth).

Itis not to be denied that this balance of palaeography and
conjecture has often seemed to waver unduly and sway unde-
sirably in favour of the latter. Bahrens’ edition of Aetna is
a sair type of what I mean. His unsurpassed mastery of the
palaeographical side of criticism was out of all proportion
greater than his feeling for niceties of diction or prosody.
Hence with all the materials before him for an able reconsti-
tution of the text of the poem, he allowed himself to be led into
wild conjectures and reckless transpositions which defy proba-
bility. It is perhaps not surprising that Sudhaus, whose edition
followed Bahrens’ at an interval of eighteen years, should
have wished to avoid his example, and set himself to the task f
of explaining the manuscript tradition even where it was
hopeless.

It will be seen from what I have said, that part of my object
in the present edition of Aetna is a polemical one. Ι wish to
controvert, partly, indeed, the actual interpretations of my
predecessor, but still more the principle on which his exegesis
