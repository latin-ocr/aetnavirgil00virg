THE DATE OF ‘AETNA'

deserves consideration. If it is true, we must suppose
Aetna to have been published after Seneca’s seventy-ninth
epistle‚ and before the eompletion of the²Fourth Book
of the Natural Questc‘ons ¹.

Ι do not think there is anything in the diction of the
poem which contravenes this view. The most noticeable
specialities are effcmare 499, succernere to sift off 495,
lentities 542, commurmurare 299. Of these succernere is
found in Cato and Pliny the Elder‚ commurmurare in
Silius Italicus. But on such a point Ι know no opinion
to which greater weight can be ascribed than that of our
own countryman, H. A. J. Munro, who, in his edition
of Aetna publ'ished in 1867, declares (p. 35) that he
⁴ cannot anyhow believe it to be older than the silver age.'

We have then two hypotheses before us, neither of them
improbable in itself, (1) that Aetna was written by some
author unknown not long after the death of Vergil, which
would better agree with its being ascribed, like the Culex
and Ciris, to him3 (2) that it is a poem of the later
Claudian or early Neronian era, and may plausibly be
assigned to Lucilius Junior, the philosophical friend and
correspondent of the younger Seneca, with whose works
and, in particular, the seven books of Natural Questions,
it shows a close and very intimate agreement.

The difficulty raised by Kruczkiewicz and Alzinger on
the ground of art applies to both hypotheses. Two of the
three works referred to in the poem as drawing visitors

² It has been observed by Sudhaus that, in the Preface to the
Fourth Book of the N. Q. ξ 10, Seneca uses the rare combination
ingenium consecrare. If the Gyraldinus may be trusted, as most
critics believe, this is the very language os Aetna 226 Ingenium
sacrare caputque attollere caelo, a verse which our extant MSS. give
corruptly Sacra per ingentem capitique attollere caelum.
