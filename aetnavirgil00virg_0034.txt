PROLEGOMENA

This leads me to another point which Alzinger’s collec-
tion of parallels‚ and more recently Sudhaus' dissertation,
bring into conspicuous prominence. Aetna exhibits a
number of coincidences in diction not only with the de
Rerum Mztura, but also with the Eclogues, Georgics, and
Aeneid. This ground, as is well known, is very dangerous
and must be trodden with extreme caution. Close agree-
ments of language are common in poets of diverse epochs,
especially at the end of a verse, and are only now and then
proofs of conscious imitation. For instance, no one could
safely infer from the occurrence in Aetna of the Vergilian
combination leuem stzpulam (Aetn. 35 5, G. i. 85) that one
of the two copied the other: nor, because Vergil twice
ends a line with maxima rerum (Aen. vii. 602, ix. 279),
is it safe to infer either that the author of Aetna had the
Aeneid before him when he wrote 631 0 maxima rerum
Et merito pietas lzomim' tutz'ssima uirtus, or that Vergil
borrowed from Aetna one of its happier dictions. It is
only when the coincidence is of a marked kind that it
becomes an argument of any value, and even then it is too
often uncertain.

The three words Felix illa dies are found four times
at the beginning of a hexameter in four different poems
written in the compass of a single century.

Ciris 27 Felix illa dies, felix et dicitur annus.

Laus Pisonis 159 Felix illa dies totumque canenda per orbem.

Manil. v. 569 Felix illa dies redeuntem ad litora duxit.

Aetna 635 Felix illa dies, illa est innoxia terra.

Putting aside Aetna, the other three poems range from
the latter part of Augustus' principate to the principate of
Caligula or Claudius But, though the fourfold coincidence
is too striking to be accidental‚ though one of the poets,
