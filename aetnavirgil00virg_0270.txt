AETN A

dant brachia, ‘ entwine‚’ more often with dat„ as in Hor. C.
ii. 12. 18, Ov. Pont. ii. 6. 13.

364 ac, VVernsdorf, for haec of most MSS. But et (Scal.) is
often interchanged with haec, and would agree with the use of
et elsewhere in the poem, eg. 299 et maguum commurmurat
Aetna, ‘and then, as a consequence.’

365—391 ‘You must not suppose that the causes of eruption
cease to act or lose their potency. The winds are ever at
hand and always working. Such cessations of action as occur
are caused by temporary obstructions, rocky masses choke
the openings either at the bottom or towards the summit.
The stoppage only makes the air rush out more violently;
then is the time for all the inflammable materials which
have their home in Aetna to burn furiously‚ sulphur, alum,
bitumen,' &c

365 mendacia uulgi. That Aetna would eventually cease to
erupt must have been a prevailing opinion in Ovid’s time, who
states it at great length M. xv. 340—355, and gives three reasons.
(1) Earth may be animated, and breathe through spiracles.
These, if earth moves its position, will change with it3 and
eruptions will cease at one place, and break out in another. (2)
The caverns in which are stored the winds that cause the erup-
tion, will be left cold and cease to store them any more ; (3) the
supply of bitumen, sulphur, and other inflammable substances
will fail. Resides, if there was a time in the past when Aetna
did not discharge fiame, a similar period may be expected in the
future. Nec quae sulpureis ardetfiarnaclbus Α elna Ignea semper
erit, neque enim suit zjgrnea semper. With Nec le decipiant . . .
mendacia cf. Ov. Her. XV. 5 5 Nec uos deczpiant blandae mendacia
linguae.

366 cessare and dare dempera depend on mendacia, as in
caecin. vi. 16 quo testimonio nunc utitur sibl emptum esse.

tempora, as Horace speaks offilga temporum : the plur. gives
the notion of shifting courses or successions of time.

367 rapiant, ⁴ to grasp again,' as if lost for a period. Perhaps
the same sense in rapuitque in fomite: flammam (Aen. i. 180),
