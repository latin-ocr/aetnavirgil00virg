PROLEGOMENA

pushes the date even further back, i.e., some little time
after the eruption of Aetna in 49 B.C., can claim the
support of a very ancient tradition, a tradition which, as
it affects one poem of the series, the Culex, goes back to
the age of Lucan, i.e., to the middle of the first century
A.D. Such a tradition may be, and no doubt is, wrong
in fathering on the author of the Georgics and Aeneid a
series of poems which do not belong to him, but it cannot
be put aside in considering the parentage and epoch of
any one of them. It forms a presumption in favour, for
all of them, of a date not far removed from the time of
Vergil. Theories like that of Hildebrandt, who imagines
our Culex to be made up of an original nucleus of ninety-
six verses, which a later age expanded into more than four
hundred, cannot be readily accepted in defiance of the
ancient statement that Lucan ¹ at an age little past boyhood
read a Culex, which was then accepted as Vergil's. We
may doubt whether Vergil was the actual author of the
Culex we have, but it requires very strong arguments to
prove that Lucan read a poem such as Hildebrandt leaves
us, a mere fragment of an ultimate total four times as
large, a fragment too arbitrarily marked off from its accre-
tions, and not rperceptibly different from them in style or
mette. If Vergil did not write our Culex, it is still an
easier hypothesis to maintain that it was the work of a
contemporary, or at least of a poet not far removed from

¹ Lucan was born Α. D. 39, died Α. D. 65 (Heitland). The reference
to the Culex is in the Lise of Lucan ascribed to Suetonius‚pracfi1t1'011e
quadam aetatem et inilia sua cum Vergilio conparans ausus sit dicere
‘et quantum nu'ln‘ restat ad Cnl1'cem.' Stat. S. ii. 7, 64, 74 says Lucan
