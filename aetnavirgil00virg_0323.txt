COMMENTARY'

Buecheler retains terris ‘ crossing seas and on land? Possibly
it is an error for taetris (salis) ‘grim forms of death’: by
drowning, pirates, banditti, wild beasts‚ and the like. Cic.
de Rep. i. 3. 6 cum 2'2552‘ dszcendi aut uisendi causa maria tra-
miltant.

570 Currimus: on this the infinitives uisere, memorare
depend: ‘we rush to see or record.' This infin. of purpose
after a verb of motion is most common after ire, currere, uenire,
mittere. Roby, Lat. Gram. ξ 1362.

572-577

Nunc iuuat Ogygiis circumdata moenia Thebis
Cernere quae fratres ille impiger ille canorus
Condere felicesque alieno intersumus aeuo

Inuitata piis nunc carmine saxa lyraque

Nunc gemina ex uno fumantia saxa uapore
Miramur septemque duces raptumque profundo. C.

572 For Ogygiis see Sclzol. Eur. Phoen. 1113 (Radtke Hermes
xxxvi. 46) Ὠγύγια προσηγορεύθη (πυλώματα), φησὶν ὁ Ἀριστόδημος,
διὰ τὸ τοῦς περὶ Ἀμφίονα καὶ Ζῆθον τειχίζοντας Θήβας παρὰ τὸν
Ὠγύγου τάφον αὐτὸς (Sc. πύλας) τάξαι.

57 3 M‘unro marked a lacuna of one v.‚ which I have conjectu-
rally supplied thus Condiderant, longo geniti post tempore

q 574 intersumus z‘s another clear gain from C : Rehd. Arund.

Perhaps pie. 576 sacra Scalzgrer.

573 Cernere must, 1 think, mean actual eye-sight3 travellers
rushed over seas to visit Thebes and realize with their own
eyes the various legends of the place; the building of its
walls by the brothers, Amphion the lyre-player (canorus),
Zethus the man of action (imnger); how the stones came
spontaneously for the building‚ answering with readiness to the
summons issued by the pious brethren: again, the legend of
the inextinguishable hate of Eteocles and Polynices, attested by
the perpetual miracle of the flames parting asunder on their
common altar; the seven chiefs; Amphiaraus swallowed with
his chariot by the Earth opening.
