AETNA

the vaulted or domed ceiling in a theatre‚ and Gudeman on
Tac. Dial. 19 cum uix in cortina quisquam adsistat (‘ a circular
space in the court-mom, which was occupied by the general
public’) still holds to this view, translating it ‘the auditorium
of a theatre.' Wernsdorf was the first to suggest that the
words lmparibus numerosa modis canit arte regentis must refer
to a musical instrument, and that the various descriptions of
the hydraulis, or water-organ, coincide sufficiently with the
whole of 295—297 to make it all but certain that the cortina
is identical with this instrument. Resides, C and Rehd. give
magnis c. theatris, S has magnisque. v alone has theatri:
and Alzinger shows that magnis theatris is Lucretian iv. 74,
vi. 109. Suetonius (Ner. 41) states that Nero had a passion
for these hydraulic instruments, and not only spent a large
part of a day in examining new and unknown forms of
them, but exhibited and discussed the various improvements,
promising to produce all of them in the tlzeatre. Again (54),
he engaged to appear in the public games as a performer on
the water-organ. From this it is clear that they were capable
of producing a very loud sound; but the shape, size, arrange-
ment of tubes, &c.‚ of course varied infinitely. The invention
is ascribed to Ctesibius, an Alexandrian barber and contem-
porary of Ptolemy Euergetes: the earliest description is by
his pupil Heron (pneumatica 227, p. 192 ed. W. Schmidt).
Vitruvius attempts, not very successfully, to make the mecha·
nism intelligible (de Archit. Χ. 8. 13). Athenaeus (174)
has a shorter account: ἐντατὸν οὖν καὶ καθαπτὸν οὐκ ἂν νομι-
σθείη· ἐμπνευστὸν δ’ ἂν ἰ’σως ῥηθείη διὰ τὸ ἐμπνεῖσθαι τὸ ὄργανον
ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀέρος. κατεστραμμένοι γάρ εἶσιν οἱ αὐλοὶ εἷς· τὸ ὕδωρ
καὶ ἀρασσομένου τοῦ ὕδατος ὑπό τινος νεανίσκου, ἔτι δὲ διικνου-
μένων ἀξινῶν (al. ἀξονίων) διὰ τοῦ ὀργάνου, ἐμπνέονται οἱ αὐλοὶ
καὶ ἦχον ἀποτελοῦσι προσηνῆ· ἔοικε δέ τὸ ὄργανον βωμῷ στρογγύλῳ.
Besides the representation of a hydraulis (first figured in Tristan’s
Commentaz'res Hz‘storiques, i. p. 219, and repeated in the Dict. of
Antiquitffis, ed. 2) on a medal of the Emperor Nero¹‚ we now
