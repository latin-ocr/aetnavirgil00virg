’ AETN'A‘

Haupt: tuens Baehrens: ut cuique decus Unger ’ 64* uictor
ledat„ aud so Asmira: stricto Birt :. perhaps moto.

Haupt’s utrimque secus is plausible, as these passages will
show: Lucilius ap. Non. 210 Zopyrion labeas caedit utrimque
secus ; Cato R. R. 21. 3 dextra sinistra foramina utrimque secus
lamminas sub lamminas . . supponit& and again 21. 4 pertu-
sum ulrimque secus. In this passage utrimque secus refers to
dextra sinistra as in the ν. of Aetna. Lucr. iv, 939 utrimque
secus cum [mpus uapulet.

secus would have its full significance: the rest of the gods
stand round on the right and left respectively. But it is lengthy
and prosaic, and ill suits the high-pitched language ofAetna:
again, if the word concealed by d? in C was an integral part
of a whole utrimque secus, its separation, not by a full point
but by the sign ; is at least strange. Following in the steps of
Baehrens Ι trace in (ίέ (deus) the remains of a nom. participle,
perhaps uerens3 of this the two first letters might fall out after
-que leaving —rens‚ which at some stage of the transmission,
possibly written in a difficult Merovingian hand, would become
deus. Ι had also thought of ciens to be constructed with ιζξηίςς
but rhythm is against this.

iacto is first found in the Paris ed. of 1507 (by Badius
Ascensius). Haupt prints it in his small Vergil (1873), but it
cannot be thought certain, owing to the doubt in 65 between
deuictae, deuectae, deiectae. MSS. there are in favour of
deuictae rather than deiectae (Peerlkamp) or deuel-tae : the latter
is too weak a word for the utter rout of the giants. Retaining
then in 65 deuictae of C (to which deiunctae of S also points),
I incline to iacto in 64 as the easiest emendation of uicto. But
molo might also pass into uicto, just as uidet in 336 looks like
a misreading of mouet. molo fulmine (flumine C absurdly, as
flumina for fulmina in 59) = ‘setting in motion‚’ ‘launching’
his bolt. Claud. Rus. i. 262 Μοιιίί tela.

66-70 atque impius hostis

Praeceptis cum castris agitur materque iacentis
Impellens uictos. tum pax est reddita mundo
Turn liber cessat uenit per sidera celum
Defensique decus mundi nunc redditur astris. C.
