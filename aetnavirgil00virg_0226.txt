autem aer sil agitatus, vi. 21 Nobis quoque placet hunc spiritum

potentius, m‘lzz’l acrius, sine quo nec illa quidem quae uehementis-
sima sunt, ualent .· ignem spiritus concitat.

213 Wagler’s emendation per sest for pars est of Gyr. restores
light to a dark line. I do not however follow him in substitut-
ing flammae of Gyr. for semper which is placed at the end of
the ν. in designed imitation of Lucretius, e. g. iii. 991, 1003.
‘Left to itself‚ violence is almost powerless; at all times
the agent of conflagration (illi in a general sense, or, reading
igni with Le Clerc‚ fire) has a natural temper of velocity and
a continual motion3 but it must be seconded by spirit, and
without spirit can effect nothing.' It does not seem to me
impossible that illi should be used in this vague manner;
it can hardly be uento, or incendio implied in incendia (211),
or uiolentiae. [Ι have preferred to print igni (Le Clerc).]

216 audet of Gyr. would be quite in Seneca’s manner: N. Q.
ii. 1 1. 1 (Aer) circa terram plurimum audet, plurimum politum
but audit of C and all extant MSS. is in perfect keeping with
qua spiritus imperat and is not to be altered.

217 magnoque (Munro) for magnosque of CS is probable‚
since magnusque cannot be an epithet of ignis, Alzinger
rightly rejects Baehrens’ conjecture Hic princeps magnus quo
sub duce which is based on the reported v. 1. in Gyr.‚ qzci‘sub
ἄκεα nor is magno quo sub duce much better. 1 suggest
gnmcosque, as in Lucr. iii. 962 aequo animoque agedum
gnomis concede should be read for magnis of MSS.

219 quae res incendia pascit is explained by Munro, ‘which
is what seeds the fires‚’ sc. the winds. It is more natural to
make it coordinate with unde ipsi uenti and quae causa silenti,
⁶ what is the substance that feeds the fire?’ all three questions
depending on Subsequor.
