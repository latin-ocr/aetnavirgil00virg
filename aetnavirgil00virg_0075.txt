THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA’

of scholars at that time, than has attended the various
efforts to bring to light the lost eighth-century codex of
Silius’ Punica ¹.

Itis not difficult to see that this belief of Heinsius, and
from him of scholars generally, has many points of attack.
The excerpts in Laur. A. 4. 36 and 33. 9 are, it is true,
supplementary to each other ,· they are valuable as repre-
senting a very ancient source 3 but it cannot be shown that
the source of the variants on In Rufinum I, the codex
Lucensis, was also the source of the other variants in the
two volumes. If it waS, why should it be called now
Lucensis, now cod. B? Such a difference of nomenclature
could only be confusing. And if the scribe who copied the
variants of In Rufinum I obtained his ‘ uetustissimus codex'
from a friend at Lucca, it is a long leap to the conclusion
of Heinsius that it must have remained there, as if it had
been in some public library. Again, allowing that this
very old MS. in possession of a Luccan, was the one fount
from which² both sets of variants on Claudian flowed, it
does not follow that the Aetna variants, though, to the
extent of sixteen verseS‚ they exist in one of the two
Laurentian MSS. , were drawn from the same Luccan
codex: still less that this so—called Luccan codex was that
from which Gyraldus early in the sixteenth century copied
Aetna. Such reasonings are fallacious: they predispose
a logical mind to suspect error in the subsequent stages of
inquiry.
