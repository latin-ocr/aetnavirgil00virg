But if, as may chance, you raise a quarrel with
me, believing the winds to rise frorn other causeS,
I reply: there is no doubt that rocks sometimes
and caverns deep below tumble forwards with a loud
crash, and that the fall causes the currents of air
in the neighbourhood to be set in motion and disperse
in all directions, and from this cause the winds wax
strong ,- or again that there are vapours which dis-
charge (air) from the abundance of their moisture,
as they often do in plains and fields bathed by a
river. Air rises in vallies and forms a dark cloud-like
mass ,- little water-courses bring with them gusts whose
force is very like wind 3 water from a distance blows
its jets upon the air-currents and flogs thern as with
a scourge. If now moisture has such potency where
there is free space to work in, its effects must be
proportionally more when under-ground and pent in.
These are the causes outside and within which do
the work: by their compelling force they set the
winds stirring3 these struggle in the narrow gullies 5
in that close struggle, the channel they traverse
chokes thern 3 as when a wave has been sucked up
again and again out in the deep sea and has
absorbed the violent east winds, the billows come
crowcling on, and the first are pushed on by that
which comes last. Even so the wind, compressed
by struggling forces, fcels their impact, and wrapping
its strength within its bulk drives the close-packed air-
purticlcs to and fro in burning rings, and hurries on
