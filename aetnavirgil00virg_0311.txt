COMMENTARY

525, 526 Few vv. are so difficult as these. C gives
Quin etiam externam multis color ipse refellit

multus Relcd. Arund. resoluit Reled.

To what noun does externam refer ? Sudh. supplies materiam,
which is so far off as to be nowhere in sight or memory. I had
thought of naturam, which occurs five lines besore3 this would
give a good sense: any idea of an extraneous substance in the
lava-stone is disproved by the colour. But etiam may be the
remains of a truncated accusative, such as speciem (often written
spetiem): spec. extem. might be ‘an alien semblance,' or possibly
(s. os‘Plcilol. 1887, p. 233) ‘an external look' in which the lapis
molaris might resemble other stones and be thought to partake
of their substance or nature. multis of C is explained by Sudh.
‘ with much circumstance,’ ‘with much positive assertion‚' as if
a legal case were being tried, and. the pleader were arguing at
length against such a view. This seems forced: multis would
more naturally be ‘for many‚’ i. e. in the judgment of not a few
who have examined the point (whether Greek writers like
Posidonius, Strabo, or the long array of names mentioned in
Seneca's Natural Questz'ons, or practical Roman travellers with
whom the poet had discussed the question): or he may have
written multus, as Ι found in Reled„ a pemadz‘ng black colour,
such as Strabo states of the lava-stone.

526 non odor aut leuitas. The ὀσμὴ and κουφότης of minerals
are often mentioned in the fragm. de lapidibus ascribed to
Theophrastus. Speaking of the friable stones of Binae, he
says, 22 ἡ δὲ ὀσμὴ βαρεῖα σφόδρα καὶ δυσχερής.

putris magis ille magisque may be parenthetical‚ and
explain leuitas (Sudhaus) z I have preferred to regard the words
as closely connected with Vna operis facies. Then (1) putris
magis ille magisque, Vna operis facies are opposed to each
other, ‘the stone decays more and more, (but) the way it
works is one and the same’3 or (2) the first magis is corre-
lative to the second magisque3 i.e. putris magis ille, nuzgisque
Vna operis-factes nearly = quo magis putris ille (lapis est), (hoc)
magis una operis facies (est).

527 perque omnia occurs in the same part of the verse in
Manil. i. 213, iv. 160; in both places -que is ‘and' Here
