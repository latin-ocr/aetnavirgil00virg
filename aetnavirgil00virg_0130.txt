these by the pressure of the south. This is the cause
of the wind's fury, this is why it convulses with an
appalling crack the foundations of the ground, thence
it is not only that cities totter in affright, but that
truer presage there is none, that the universe will
resume, if we may believe it without impiety, the
chaotic look it originally bore.

Such, in the first instance, being the character
and nature of the earth, it draws off inwardly into
channels in every direction, while the surface-soil
itself remains inactive. Aetna is its own palpable‚
its own most credible voucher. Follow my lead
and you shall not probe for occult reasons there:
they will present themselves spontaneously to your
mind and extort confession. 'For indeed that moun-
tain lays its world of wonders bare to the eye ε at one
point are huge openings to appal the spirit and
plunge it in an abyss: at another it calls to
order at its inner part limbs elsewhere thrust out
too far: at another point crowding rocks block
the way, a wild scene of confusion: these cross
their texture multifariously‚ or stop its progress half-
way, now reduced by the action of fire, now
constrained to bear successive fires still. Such is the
world-famed appearance and doinain of Aetna’s divine
activity: such its seat and free field of marvellous

operations.
