PREFACE

is based. It is, I imagine, of importance at this particular
junctum, to re-assert with more than usual emphasis the
existence of the trained critical faculty3 a faculty which is
competent to reject the impossible in language, syntax, or
metre‚ however strongly it may be supported by early manu-
script tradition, and however plausibly it may be shown to be
quite explicable. There is a growing school of critics, not
only in Germany but England, the central point of whose creed
is virtually to deny this. Several years ago ¹ I raised my voice
against one of the boldest exponents of this creed : the present
volume is meant to prove that I have not abandoned my
colorus.

The audacity and independence of Sudhaus’ Aetna naturally

illus. liv. 1—8‚ Philologus, lvii. 603—641. Most of their remarks
will be found either in the App. Crit. of my edition or discussed
at more length in the Commentary. Besides these I do not
know of anything which has appeared within the last few
years except F ranke's Res Men-ica Aetna· Carminis (Marburg,
1898) and F. &Valter’s Zur T extbelmndlung und zur Auloffrage
des Aetna (Blatter fiir Bayer. Gymnasialschulwesen, xxxv.
Jahrgang).

Ι subjoin a list of the MSS. and other subsidia used for this
edition.

C of the tenth century in the University Library of Cambridge,
Kk v. 34.

This is by far the best MS. of Aetna. It contains also the
Culex. Its readings were first published in their entirety by
H.A.J.Munro in 1867. I transcribed the whole of C for this
edition.

S = fragmentum Stabulense, 17, 177 in the National Library
of Paris, once in the Monastery of Stavelot (see Proleg.‚ p. lv).
This fragment consists of some badly preserved leaves of cent. xi,
containing in double columns, tolerably complete, Aetn. 1—170‚
215—258‚ 260—3013 in a truncated form, 171—213, 303—345.

¹ In a review of Leo’s Culex, Academy sor 1891, no. 1016.
