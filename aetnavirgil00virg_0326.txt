merit.’ Xenophon de rep. Laced. xi. 6, says of this: οὕτω δὲ ῥᾴδιον
ταίτην τὴν τάξιν μαθεῖν, ὡς ὅστις τοὺς ἀνθρώπους δύναται γιγνώσκειν,
οὐδεὶς ἂν ἁμάρτοι· τοῖς μὲν γὰρ ἡγεῖσθαι δέδοται, τοῖς δέ ἕπεσθαι
τέτακται. The Enomoty would thus be strictly sua turba regenti,
a band their captain swayed at will. It would be sacer numerus
as a troop bound by religious rites. Alzinger shows that
numerus is so used even by Sallust (Cat. 33. 1), and Munro
affirms it of the silver age and Tacitus.

Sudhaus and Buecheler, however, suggest trecenti sor recenti,
and explain of the 300 Spartans who fell at Thermopylae ‘the
number hallowed for war, their own all-sufficient host, the
Three Hundred.’ Buecheler cites one of the Suasoriae of
the elder Seneca (11) which is occupied with this subject.
The word trecenti occurs eleven times in this piece, and is in
antithesis to treceni, the 300 sent severally by the other states
of Greece. The whole Suasoria is a commentary on the verse.
ξ 5 (ed. Bursian) Ideo hanc Eurotas amnis circunfiuit qui
pueritiam indurat adficturae militiae patientiam. . . . Lacones
se nu mera nt, non aestimant. uideamus quanta turba sit,
ut habeat certe Sparta, etiamsi non fortes milites, ad (at) nun-
tios ueros. § 8 Videat trecentos Xerses et sciat quanti bellum
aestimatum sit, quanto aptus numero locus. § 14 Ut reuertar
act Leonidam et trecentos. . . . De positione loci eleganter dixit
Haterius, cum angustias loci fizcnndissime descripsisset: natus
trecentis locus. And particularly § 18 Ad, inquit, trecenti
πωπω,- et ita respondit: trecenti, sed uiri, sed armati, sed
Lacones, sed ad T ltermopylas; numquam uidi pl ures tre·
centos. These four words may help us to understand sua turba.
We may imagine the 300 Spartans saying to each other: ‘We
may be only 300; but it would be hard to find a 300 as numerous.’
sua turba is of course in reference to trecenti, like pars sna to
parentem in M anil. iv, 884, 885 nostrumque parentem Pars sua
perspicimus. It cannot mean, as we might be tempted to believe,
‘a host in themselves': suus is in reference to the idea se
numerandi, counting their number, and then estimating its
worth not b‘y the total which numerically they reach, but by the
training, endurance, resolution, &c. which make up a Spartan
soldier. The 300 at Thermopylae were proverbial, eg. Ampelius
