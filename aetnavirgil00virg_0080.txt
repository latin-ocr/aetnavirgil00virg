PROLEGOMENA

quam pars est uiolentia against par est of C, for parsest is
a corruption of penest, the excellent emendation of Wagler 3
141 Antraque demersas penitus fodisse latebras against A.
demissa pedibus fodisse latebris3 169 densaque premit pre-
miturque ruina Mine euri boreaeque notus nune liuius
uterque est against densique premunt premiturque ruina Μινα-
furtim boreaeque noto nuuc liuius uterque est 3 in this case
the genuineness of Gyr. is not lessened, but increased
by the unintelligible est3 165 aquasque against -a quaeque
of C, leading as it does to the emendation of Munro
acuatque (now generally accepted) 3 187 incendii where C
gives incendi 3 the -ii, though unmetrical, is exactly the sort
of error (if we may rightly call error what was probably
explanation¹) which belongs to an early source 3 263 gleb-
arum expendimus usum 3 against g. expellimur usu of C 3
266 duro against diuiti of C, for though duro cannot be
right, its close agreement with dura et of the Paris and
Escorial excerpts points to an early source 3 220 Cur subito
cohibent iners for Cum s. cohibetur, inest pointing to cohibentur,
iners 3 27 5 uzzcltum against multos of C, pointing to mutum,
the emendation of Haupt3 278 Tartara rumpi against
Tartara muudi of C 3 283 tenues in se abstrahat auras for
neue inse abstrahat auras of C 3 178 illi against Illinc of C.

Others are good or plausible in themselves but such as
would easily occur to any scholar well trained in Latin
poetry 3 138 densaque abscondita nocte for densaeque a. nocti
of C 3 151 flammaeue ruit for flamma uerrit of C 3 153
hiantes for lu'atu of C 3 155 in omui for inomni of C ;
157 conserta immobilis esset sor, confert immobilis e. of C 3

¹ 1 mean that incendi being doubtfully genitive 01· infin. pass.‚ the

retention against metre os the double -ii was a mark of its being
genitive.
