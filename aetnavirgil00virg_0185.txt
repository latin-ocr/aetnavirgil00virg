COMMENTARY.

5 Seu te Cynthos habet seu delos gratior ila
Seu tibi dodona potior. C.
Munro’s emendation of these vv.
Seu te Cynthos habet seu delost gratior Hyla
Seu tibi Ladonis potior,
is supported (1) by the form ila of C, which is not likely to be
merely a mis—spelling of illa; (2) by the absence of any well-
established connexion between Apollo and Dodona ; (3) by the
natural consecution of two Oriental shrines of Apollo, Hyle in
Cyprus, Daphne near Antioch.

But may not Dodona be abl.? So Bormans thought, writing
Ac tibi Dodona potior, ‘and preferred by thee to Jove’s own
inspired Dodona.⁷ Statius, Theb. viii. 195 sqq„ after mentioning
Delphi, Tenedos, Chryse, Delos, Branchidae, Claros, Didymi,
goes on to add the shrines of Ammon in Libya, Jupiter at
Dodona, Apollo at Thymbra. But the introduction of two
shrines of Jupiter among those of Apollo is there intelligible:
every famed μαντεῖον will be silent for anguish at the loss of
Apollo’s seer. Cf. Theb. iii. 107, 8. In Aetn. 5, 6 such
a reference to non-Apollinean μαντεῖα would be out of place
and confusing.

Possibly dodona is a corruption of colofczna.

Colophon and the adjoining grove of the Clarian Apollo are
constantly mentioned among the most famous seats of the god's
worship. Strab. 642. Plin. H. N. ii. 232 Colophonem Apollinis
Clarii specu lacuna est cuius potu mira redduntur oracula.
It was visited by Germanicus, Tac. Ann. ii. 54 adpellitque·
Colophona ut Clarii Apollinis oraculo uteretur. non semina
