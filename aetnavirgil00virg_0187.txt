COMMENTARY

MS„ we assign a superior weight, we shall accept in rather than
et; and it seems translatable‚ constructing Quicquid (or, as
with Lachmann 1 prefer to write it, Quidquid) with iactata cst
on the analogy of ,Liv. vii. 32. 6 quidquid ab urbe longius
proferrent arnm3 xxxi. Ι. 5 iam prouideo animo quidquid pra-
gredior in uastiorem me altitudinem prouelzi3 xxxiv, 62. 12 quid-
quid Bursam sedem suam excesserint ; Luc. iii. 294 Quidquid ab
occiduis Libye patet arida Asaurz’s; Claud. in Eutrop. i. 196
quidquid se T zgrris ab Haemo dl'm'dit3 see Heinsius on Claud. de
Mall. Theod. Cons. 56. On this view quidquid iactata est
'expresses the manzsold forms which the legends of Greece had
assumed in their poetry: ‘the countless variations of legend
thrown into antique song.’
Ι would, however, suggest that in may be a mistake for id,
Quidquid id antiquum, iactata est fabula, carmen
‘ whatever the particular song of the past, the legend is now
well-worn‚’ i. e. every one of the ancient myths has been used 4,
by some poet and has become trite and hackneyed. On
this view, which (except id) is Sudhaus’, ‘ Kurz, all die alten
Lieder sind ein verbrauchter Stoff‚’ iactata refers to the fre-
quency with which the Greek myths had been used as matter
for poetry, bandied about and passing from hand to hand as
public property. For quidquid id, quisquis is, cf. my note
Noct. Manil. p. 188, and to the passages cited there add Lucr.
iii. 135, Verg. Aen. ii. 49, Stat. S. i. 6. 49, Nem. Cyn. 219
Quidquid id est.
Mumo, however, thought 23 a conflation of two verses:
Quidquid in antiqu[o narratur tempore gestum (or, gestum
est memorabile saeclo)
Omnis per uari]urn iactata est fabula carmen.
25, 26 Quae tanto moles operi, quae tanta perenni
Explicet in densum flammas. C.
quae tanta CS . qis tanta Rehd. uis quanta tlte present
editor quae causa perennis Sloan 777 26 in denso
C. A. Schmid.
The second quae has no noun following it in CS: some
of the fifteenth century MSS. give causa for tanta and perennis.
This is not improbable in itself; but there are other possibilities.
