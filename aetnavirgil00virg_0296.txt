AETNA

ex longinquo tutoque speculetur is given by Gertz’ excellent
MS. A.

465 This verse has two unclassical uses :

1. effiruent, not found in any writer of authority. The infini-
tive efferue‘re however occurs in Lucr. ii. 928, Verg. Georg.
iv. 556.

2. honerosa in the sense of ‘loaded with ’ followed by abl. of
the thing loading: usually honerosus=burdensome‚ and is
followed by a dat. of the thing burdened, as in Ov. Μ. ix. 54
tergoque honerosus inhaesit. The h is quite correct, as in
holus: see Munro’s note. No weight can be given to Relzd.'s
v.l. numerasset. raptis seems to give the idea of the rocks
which have been dislodged and are now in upheaval as so
much spoil of the flames. [Ulitius conj. operosae incendia
rupis]

466 truncae, ‘ mutilated‚’ torn into shapeless masses.

467 The order is Prouoluunt exam. harenae adque astra
sonant, the last three words interjected and not affecting the
construction of examina as depending on Prouoluunt. This
interjection of the clause is justified by the poet's wish to
connect closely in words, as they are in nature, the terrific
sound in the sky with the rising of the huge masses of rock
which are ejected from the crater, and carry with them quanti-
ties of sand. [The MS. reading truncaeque ruinae Prouolzcunt
atque alra sonant ex. harenae leaves Prouolmmt without an
accus„ and must Ι think be wrong]

469-473 describe the fantastic shapes which the ejected rocks
assume. They have a human semblance, some like troops
under defeat, some maintaining a sturdy resistanee to the
flames: here the burning lava refuses to give in and spreads
out its contingents, there it is gradually abating, and its force
dying down.

468 incertae, irregular, i.e. such as might present a different
notion to different observers.

469 Birt compares 185 Pars zgrm· domitae, pars zgrnes serre
coactae.

469 domim slantls, as in so many cases in Catullus, xvii. 24,
xxii. 12, xliv. 18, lxiii. 53, lxiv. 186, lxvii. 32 ς· in Tibullus i. 5. 283
