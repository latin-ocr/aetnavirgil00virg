THE DATE OF ‘AETNA’

may therefore have been as an Oceam‘d that Aetna was
(ex hypothesi) called Perseis. But the other view, that
it is as a Titanic power that she was so called, is far
more likely from the natural and intimate connexion of
subterranean and volcanic phenomena with Titans, Giants,
Cyclopes, ἃς. This is a fact too well established to need
any further enlargement here.

The passage of the Clementine Homilies then, I pro-
pose to emend thus—[Afrum τῇ] Περσαίου, νύμφῃ, ’γενόμενος
γύψ, ἐξ ἧς οἱ ἐν Σικελίᾳ Παλικοί.

If the v. of Ovid's last Pontic Epistle (Trinacriusque
suae Perseidos auctor) is to be explained of Aetna, it
is obvious that the hitherto meaningless suae has a
defined and easily felt significance. Trinacrius is ‘the
composer of liis own Perseis‚' because he selected to bear
that name his own heroine, Aetna, daughter of the Titan
Perses, not Hecate, nor Circe's mother, as most other
poets had done: or, if Trinacrius¹ is not the actual
name of the writer, but merely a variation on Siculus, Ovid
would mean that the Sicilian composer of Perseis had
fixed on an epichorian, not Italian or Helle1]ic‚⁷‘7p‹n[v⁷7‚
to form the subject of his verses. The fact that Perseis

Triniacre. uxot-ip. Mr. Haverfield, however, has not been able to find
Trinacrius as a proper name in the C. l. L.; it must therefore, if
existent, be rare. The first impression of the passage is distinctly,
I think, in favour of its being an actual name, especially in its com-
bination with Lupus, which is certainly such. Trinacriusque suae
Perseidos auctor, ct auctor Tantalidae reducis YJ'ndaridosque Lupus,
Almost all the poets mentioned by Ovid in this long catalogue
(Ep. Pont. iv. 16) are called by their names; and is Trinacria is the

genuine appellation of a woman, there seems to be no reason sor
denying Trinacrius similarly to a male.
