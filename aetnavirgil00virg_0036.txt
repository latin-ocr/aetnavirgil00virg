PROLEGOMENA

the action of Cymodocea's one disengaged hand. It is less
apt when transferred to the action of air by which the water
of a hydraulic orgari is set in motion.

Aetn. 608 Et nitidum obscura caelum caligine torquet.
G. ἰ. 467 Cum caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit.

The two passages seem mutually dependent ; but the
first is obscure and not easily intelligible: the latter aptly
describes the aspect of mourning which the sun assumed
before the murder of Caesar. It is a reasonable inference
that the finer passage suggested the weaker, and that the
master-work of Rome’s greatest poet was the source whence
the unknown versifier drew his inspiration.

The same may be said of locutions recognizably Vergilian,
but in themselves violent and only admitted as part of the
available stock of poetic diction from the aeknowledged
supremacy of the master, e. g. se rmnpere=to burst forth,
applied in the first Georgic to rays of the sun (i. 445 densa
inter nubila sese Diuersi rumpent radii), in the Aeneid to
a storm of rain (xi. 548 tantus se nubibus imber Ruperat),
in Aetna to outbursts of volcanic flame (361 Ardentesque
simul flammas ac fulmina rumpunt).

Or, again, of combinations like terque quaterque (G. ii.
399, Aen. i. 94, iv. 589, xii. 155), borrowed by Vergil from
Homer, and imitated thenceforward by successive poets
indiscriminately.

We have besides an external testimony of no mean
weight to assist our judgment on the point. Macrobius,

of the greatest and some of the smallest names are included,
