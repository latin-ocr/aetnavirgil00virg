COMMENTARY

to yielding (cedunt) and soft (tenerrima) ones. As for 152, it
is unintelligible in Gyr„ lucid in CS: causa alone requires
changing, for which I accept Le Clerc’s caula ‘barrier‚’
‘enclosure,’ or possibly, as Nettleship shows from Lucretius
( C ontrz'butions lo Latin Lexicograplzy‚ s.v.)‚ ‘ opening,' like per
caulas corporis, caula palmi, aetheris.
158 sqq.

Sed summis si forte putas concredere causis

Tantum opus et summis alimentum uiribus oris

Quae ualida inpromptu cernis ualidosque recessus

Fallere sed nondum tibi lumine certaque retro. C.

158 subitis Gyr. congerdere v: concrescere Gyr.,perlzaps
concedere. 159 et subitis Gyr. ora Gyr. 160
Quod Gyr. ualida . . . ualidosque MSS. patula . . . uastos-
que Gyr. 161 Falleris et nondum certo tibi lumine res est
(Jyr.

Here the critic’s duty lies straight before him. W'e have
to choose between an actual text vitiated indeed, but recover-
able with only slight corrections (C), and a series of reported
variants which in no way carry conviction (Gyr.).

The text of C in 158—160 may be retained by writing concedere
(158), θνα (159), Qua or Quod (160); 1161 calls for separate
discussion.

‘ Summis causis et non abstrusioribus,' Scal. 3 ‘ causes arising
on the surface‚' Munro: Seneca, N. Q. vi. 30. 3 says aliquanto
plus impetus habent quae ex infimo ueniunt: the poet is here
stating the counter hypothesis that the explosions of Aetna may
be attributable to causes near the top. concedere is the simplest
correction of concredere ‘gives way to‚’ ‘is a concession to’:
with reference to the overpowering forces at work in the volcano.
l see no cause to suspect alimentum=a1imentorum, see N eue-
Wagener‚ Formenlehre, i. 114, but oris must be wrong: possibly
an error for θνα, ualida ora co-ordinating with ualidos recessus:
at the end of a verse the last letter might easily be obscured.
Quae is less probably Quod than Qua ‘at the point where you
see vast fissures': ualida ‘ puissant,' i. e. proving the strength of
the powers that cause them, ἰσχυρά. It is noticeable that the
repeated summis has its counterpart in the repeated ualida . . .
