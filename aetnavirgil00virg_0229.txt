COMMENTARY

are the scene, I suggested (J. Plzilol. for 1895, pp. 9, 10) that
the words as given by C might be a corruption of Sacra per
ingenii caelestia tollere captum, ‘to exalt the sanctities of the
sky by the grasp of intellect'; i.e. to employ the capacities
of our intellect in examining natural phenomena, and thus exalt
their marvellousness. Such a conj. is of course purely tentative:
yet it must not be forgotten that as eminent a critic as Peerl-
kamp doubted the now generally accepted reading of Gyr„
and retaining sacra substituted peragrantem sor perurgentem ¹.]

227 sunt which S had originally may be right, as it agrees
with the other indicatives metuunt, pergunt, religata est, lunaest.

fatalia of Gyr. is not so good as natalia of CS and the
Escorial excerpts, because it would not be possible for the most
advanced science to know how many times the universe was
destined to corne into new existence: scire is inconsistent with
satum, about which guessing is all that is possible. Whereas
natalia aptly expresses the prevailing theories as to the periodic
destruction and re·creation of the cosmos, a question which
goes back to the predecessors of Plato and Aristotle. Tim.
28 sqq„ de Cael. x., SerV. on G. ii. 336 Varro z’n satura quae
inscribitur de salute, sic: mundum haud natum esse neque
more] Plato autem non nalum aut mori,· Aletrodorzcs autem,
neque natum neque mori,· Zenon, ex Ιιοι· mundo quamuis aliqua
intereant, tamen ipsum perpetuo manere, quia inhaereant ei
elementa, e quibus generantur materiae, ut dixit crescere qui-
dem sed ad interitum non peruenire, manentibus elementis α
quibus rezcalescat: and is familiar to Lucretius v. 1112 sqq,
Propertius iii. 5. 29, Manilius i. 122 sqq. Quem (mundum) siue
ex nullis repetentem semina rebus Natali quoque egere placet
semperque fuisse: Lucan i. 79 sqq„ and Seneca, e.g. Dial. vi.
26. 6 cum tempus aduenerit, quo se mundus renouatzcrus ex-
tinguat; xi. 1. 2 Mundo quidam minantur interitum et hoc
uniuersum dies aliquis dissipabit: Epigr. vii. 4 and 6: N. Q.
iii. 28 fin. and especially 29. Vergil must have had such a theory
in view when he fancifully imagines that the world was born

Spartianus’ Life os Septimius Severus in the Historia Augusta⁷ c. xxiii
