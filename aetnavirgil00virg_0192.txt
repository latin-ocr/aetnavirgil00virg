AETNA

petulans audacia sensus. Here it resers to the defiant or con-
tumelious character of Enceladus, which survived his confine-
ment under Aetna. See Duff on Juv. iii. 278 Ebrius ac
petulans. Badius Ascensius’ explanation of petulans as refer-
ring to the uncontrollecl moventenls of the restless giant is less
probable ; nor is it merely ‘ fretful.'

historia rerum nostrarum facta est mendosior, ‘ inore faulty.'

76 rerum fizllacia, things shown in a deceptive and wrong
light, according to the fancy of the poet. scaenae cannot
be taken with rerum as if the sense were ‘ most stage shows’
(most of the scenes exhibited on the stage) are delusions.
Postgate’s scaena et rerum fizllacia is elever, but Plurima
pars requires some genitive, and the elision at the end of
the second soot is faulty.

77 uiderunt is not beyond suspicion, though neitherfinxerunt

is more than a possible emendation. ‘The poet’s eye’ has
become familiar to us from Shakespeare: but the idea was not
so common in antiquity. Lucretius, however, lends himself
to this conception in such passages as v. 148 Tenuis enim
natura deum longeque remota Sensibus ab nostris animi uix
mense uidelur3 183 Quid uellent facere ut scirent animoque
uiderent? [Perhaps adierunt]

79 is perhaps spurious: for uates is an inane tautology, -que
in a doubtful position, canentes utterly seeble. If not spurious,
it is entirely vitiated. Scaliger changed canentes to canesque,
and Peerlkamp supports this by Luc. vi. 733 Stygiasque canes
