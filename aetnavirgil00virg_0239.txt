COMMENTARY

diuos (Cyn), but is a Lucretian touch: such infinitives are
common in him at the end of a v., conuertere quisse v. 1422,
posse 1264, ii. 566, 743, potesse ii. 1010, and cs. v. 1130 Quam
regere imperio res uelle et regna tenere.

255 recalls Cic. de Div. ii. 30 Democritus tamen non inscite
nugatur, ut physicus, quo genere nihil adrogantius, Quod est
ante pedes nemo spectat, caeli scrutantur plagas, and Linden-
bruch quotes the remark of the crone to Thales when, in observ-
ing the stars, he fell into a well, Σὺ γάρ, ὦ Θαλῆ, τὰ ἐν ποσὶν οὗ
δυνάμενος ἰδεῖν, τὰ ἐπὶ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ οἴει ’γνώσεσθαις Diog. L.
Thal. 34. transire ac perdere, to neglect, and so lose the
advantage it might bring. For segnes of Crv segnem (Jacob)
seems necessary.

256 premimur is a favourite word with our poet ; terimur of
Gyr. is comparatively coarse, perhaps an imitation of G. iv. 114
(Alzinger).

257 (278) Sen. ad Helv. x ,Non est necesse scrutari omne
profundum, a passage closely resembling this. profundum, not
the sea, but the depths of earth, as in 545 quaedam fortasse
profundo lncomperta iacent, 577 raptumque profunde (Munro).

258 (279) argenti semen as semen (aureae) uenae in Ov. M.
xi. 144, 5 Nunc quoque iam ueteris percepto semine uenae A rua
rigent auro madidis pallentia glaebis, ‘ germ? Ovid again
combines uena, semina Trist. i. 8. 41, 2 Et tua sunt silicis
circum praecordia uenae Et rigidum ferri semina pectus habet
(Wemsdorf).

259 (280) Torrentur of Gyr. is no improvement on T orquen-
tur of the other MSS. The earth is ‘put to the torture,’ as
Munro translates, citing Plin. ii. 157 aquis, ferro, ligno, zgm',
lapide, fruge omnibus cruciatur horis (terra),

260 pretio, by the ore which is extracted from the earth.
uerum, ‘the truth‚' i.e. ‘where' its treasures are ' (Munro), the
fact which lies concealed in its interior. prcffessae, after making
a declaration: regular of specifications of income.

261 taceant, ‘is reduced tosilencess has nothing more to
say, and is left to contempt and destitution. There may be in
taceant some notion of the silence of a forsaken mine, no
, longer resonant with tools or the voices of men.
