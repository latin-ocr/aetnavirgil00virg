rorum Jacob for rerum. Munro on Lucr. i. 496 shows that
ras is used by Lucretius for water or moisture generally, and
both he and Haupt accept Jacob's emendation, which certainly
avoids the awkwardness of supplying sontes or mnores in 316.
Yet such changes of subject are quite in the style of Aetna, and
Walter urges with some force in support of the MS. reading
rerum the precisely similar ipsa palentia rerum in Manil. i. 36.

The difficulty of these vv. centres in coactus. Jacob was the
first to retain coactus as a nom. plur. =compulsions ‘demonstrauit
