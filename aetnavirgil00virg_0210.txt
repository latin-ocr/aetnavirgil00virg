161, if C may be trusted to have followed its archetype faith—
fully, could never have been as stated from Gyr„ Falleris et
noudum ceria tibi lumine res esi, which amounts to an entire
dislocation of the five concluding words. Fallere sed, indeed,
can be nothing but Falleris et; but this does not prove the
rest of the emendation1 (for such it surely must have been).
In the saurual of Plzilology for 1887, p. 297, I suggested for
noudum tihi lumine certaque retra what at least is nearer palaeo-
graphically noudum libi lumine certa liquet res3 here lumine
must be taken closely with certa ‘ the matter is not yet clear to
you in a light which makes it certain’: liquet is a favourite
word with Seneca, N. Q. vi. 5. 1 Quidam liquere {fisis aliquam
ex istis causam esse dixerunt. OV. Trist. iii. 3. 27 liquet lzoc,
carissima, nobis. Gell. i. 3. 3 noudum milii plane liquet,
xviii. 5. 11 ut nou turbidae fidei nec ambiguae, sed ut purae
liquentisque esset. The rhythm is imitated from Lucretius, e. g.
i. 893 manifesta docet re5, ii. 123 magnarum parua potest res,

Gyr. is here again, as in the preceding vv„ so widely
removed from CS as to call for special caution. (1) Every word
differs except omnis, (2) Gyr. will not scan without the addition
