AETNA

freedom, but my care is wholly centred in truth.
I will tell what is the nature of the motion that makes
Aetna boil and seethe, and how with restless greed
it gathers to itself a store of ever-new fire.
Wherever the earth's huge ball extends, girt
about by the winding shores of its bounding sea,
it is only partially a solid, everywhere the ground
falls into chasms, everywhere has been split into
cracks, or, hollowed to its centre with covert-ways,
shoots into narrow avenues and hangs in a vault3
and as in the living creature there are veins which
traverse the whole body in all directions, along which,
to maintain life, the whole of the blood passes to
and fro to the same one being 5 so the earth draws
in and distributes through its chasms air. Either,
that is to say, when in past ages the body of the
universe was divided into sea, earth, stars‚ the sky
had the first allotment‚ next the sea, earth sank down
to the lowest place, yet so that it was drilled with many
winding cavities here and there3 and just as stones of
uneven size thrown at random spring up into a heap,
forming a hollow which, voided by successive spaces
within, hangs upon itself 3 so the earth, figured similarly,

expands into slender channels, and does not all close
