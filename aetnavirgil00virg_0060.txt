PROLEGOMENA

scarcely credible corruptions: words are wrongly divided,
whole or half-lines omitted, crosses or other marks of a lost
meaning appended 3 and in the more difficult or scientific
sections of the poem, the reader is left to feel for a meaning
which obstinately refuses to come into sight. Anybody
may test this for himself by a glance at the earliest editions,
which were all printed from these fifteenth-century MSS„
‘or at the explanations of corrupt passages proposed in these
editions by the scholars of the latter fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries. Even Scaliger, who edited the Pseudo-
Vergilian opuscula in 1572, with all his vast knowledge and
his trained critical acumen, could makelittle of his bad
materials, and by the confession of Haupt, has not been
successful in his explanation of Aetna. Nor were the
scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ’
Heinsius, Le Clerc, Wernsdorf, much better off than their
predecessors. Heinsius, indeed, knew at least some of the
lections ascribed to the so-called Gyraldizms 3 and in his
second edition of Claudian (1665), dedicated to Christina
of Sweden, corrects some of the obscure passages of Aetna
by their help. But none of these scholars had seen the
Cambridge MS.; and even as late as 1837, when Haupt
published his Quaestl'ones Catullianae, in which Aetna is
treated at considerable length, he had not heard of the
existence of this, the one priniary source for the constitu-
tion of the poem in its entirety.

Treading closely in the steps of Munro, whose complete
collation of C, published in 1867, must, as I would again
ensorce, be considered the first step towards a persectly
ade—quate criticism of Aetna, I will now descend to a more
particular examination of some of the points in which C,
with the Stabulensian fragment S, forms a class distinct
