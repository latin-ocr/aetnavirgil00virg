COMMENTARY

but of volcanos in other parts of Italy or the adjacent islands:
the districts near Cumae and Naples, and the islands Aenaria,
Strongyle, and Hiera. But it is certain to me that cauerna is
rarely, if ever, the crater in our poet, see 31 clausis resonare
cauernis, 126 fluunt tectis adoperta cauernis, and especially 307
rupes aliquas penitusque cazeermzs3 so, too, here he may have in
view the hollow and cavernous configuration of such regions
generally. Lucan x. 447, 448 Nec secus in Siculis fureret tua
flamma cauernis, Obstrueret summam si quis tibi, Mulciber,
Aetnam seems to oppose the caverns in the lower part of Aetna
to the crater at the top.

425 nascentis is, slightly emphasized‚ ‘springing naturally.’
Gercke's gliscentis is unnecessary.

426 coloris. Theophrastus, quoted by Scaliger, says the colour
of the Aetnean lava was black. διαφορὰς δέ ἔχουσι πρὸς ἀλλήλας
καὶ χρώματι καὶ πυκνότητι καὶ βάρει. χρώματι μὲν ὅτι μέλαινα ἡ ἐκ τοῦ
ῥύακος τοῦ ἐν Σικελίᾳ, Theophr. fragm. de lapid. 22 ed. Wimrner
tom. iii. p. 39: and so Poseidonius ap. Strab. 269 τακείσης ἐν τοῖς
κρατῆρσι τῆς πέτρας εἶτ’ ἀναβληθείσης, τὸ ὑπερχυθὲν τῆς κορυφῆς
ὑγρὸν πηλός ἐστι μέλας ῥέων κατὰ τῆς ὀρεινῆς· εἶτα πῆξιν λαβὼν γίνε·
ται λίθος· μυλίας, τὴν αὐτὴν φυλάττων χρόαν ἣν ῥέων εἶχε (Sudhaus).

428—432 are thus written in C:

Dicitur insidiis flagrans enarea quondam

N unc extincta super testisque neapolin inter
Et cumas locus et multis iam frigidus annis ,
Quamuis aeternum pinguescat etubere sulphur
In mercem legitur tanto est fecundius aethna.

428 flagrasse Wesseling 429 tectisque Rehd. In MS.
D’ Orv. 195 the vv. ll. ascribed to P. Pithou give on 428 ‘in m.
superestss and on 429 ‘Corrigitur: exstin super testisque cta:

testis-superque- (sic) Neapolin? Perhaps Nunc exstincta [diu],

superestque N. inter 430 perhaps ex multis 431
pingui scatet ubere the present editor in Journ. of Pln'lol. 1871,
p. 276.

There is no reason to doubt insidiis (for which de Serionne
substituted indiciis), constructed closely with flagrans or fla-
grasse, ‘to have burst into flame by surprise,’ nearly=per
insidias. Hild. cites Plin. H. N. ii. 203 in proof of Monte
