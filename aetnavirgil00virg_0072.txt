PROLEGOMENA

This takes us a step farther ,- Heinsius, if we may believe
Burmann, himself made a collation of these readings.
This need not mean more than that he copied them into
some edition of Aetna at second hand: it is not certain
that he ever saw the whole passage 138-285 as copied in
extenso from the lost Lucca codex, or even the complete
collection of excerpted readings we now possess. It was
his habit to enter the variants of important MSS. in the
margin of printed editions: and the younger Burmann
states that two copies of Pithou's Epigrammata et Poematia
Vetera (Paris, 1590) were so used by him ¹.

It is possible, but not proved, that one of these Heinsian
copies of Pithou's Epigrammata is identical with the
volume from which the Iena editor and later Matthiae
drew the complete collection of Gyraldinian Extracts.
Matthiae's is the fuller and more exact account, he states
that the copy of Pithon from which the Gyraldinian extracts
came, had, written on the back of the title-page, ‘ In Aetna
V. signficat cod. Florentinum, quem inde habuit Ernstius,
nempe solam partem illam) This can only mean2 that
where the letter V (Vetus) was added to a v. l. in the
margin of the pages of Pithou containing Aetna, that v. l.
was drawn from a MS. at Florence 3 which MS„ i. e. the
part of it containing that portion of Aetna to which
the vv. ll. referred, came into the possession of Ernst: in
other words, Ernst had a copy of Aetas. 138-285 as written
in a Florence MS.

It is unfortunate that we do not know certainly who

¹ Wagler, pp. 11, 12.

²¹ Birt, however, Claud. p. lxxxix, thinks that quem refers to Actna3
which, though Aetna is found occasionally masc.‚ or the writer os the
note may have thought of the mountain, seems to me improbable.
