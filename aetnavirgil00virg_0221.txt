COMMENTARY

from the inner shrines‚’ where the mysterious operations of the
volcano are enacting. The spelling of S aduitus is rather in
favour of this ¹.

192, 193 form a proper introduction to the doubtful v. Ut
maior species etne succurrat inanis, which ln the MSS. is found
also aster 185. The gods forbid close access to Aetna's fires, so
to invest the mountain with greater pomp ². But when we turn
to details, there is some perplexity. What is succurrat, and
why inanis? lf inanis is right, it must have some special force,
and cannot be a mere epithet3 such a sense has been found
by translating ‘when Aetna is raked out,' i. e. when an erup-
tion has occurred to drive into air part of its interior³, ancl
strike awe into the beholder. This does some violence to the
Latin. It would be less harsh to read in annis, and this would
also agree better with succurrat, ‘that Aetna’s majesty, as years
advance‚ may rise more imposingly on the view‚’ i. e. that in
proportion to the difficulty of ascertaining the causes of the
volcanic phenomena‚may be the feeling of solemnity and mystery
which the sight of Aetna occasions, increasing with tirne as it
becomes more and rnore inexplicable 4.

Against both of these views is the sense given to succurrat,
which ordinarily means (1) to come to the rescue‚ (2) to occur,
as a thought, to the mind, not the eyes. Hence the suggestion
which I made in Journ. ‘ff Philol. for 1892, p. 227 to write et ne
for elne or elltne : then the nominative to succurrat will be cura,
‘the god’s care for creation is without witness, in order to
heighten the effect of the show, and that it (sc. cura) may not
intersere inefficaciously.’ succurrat would imply that the upheaval

³ Neai-ly so Chenu, who, however, places the v. after 185, ‘Ainsi
l'Etna, creuse dans l’interieur de sa masse, nous apparait sous un
aspect plus merveilleux encore.’
