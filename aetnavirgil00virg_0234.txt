ἕπην τριτόωσαν ὅλος περὶ κύκλος ἑλίσσῃ Πάντῃ ἐρευθόμενος, μάλα
κεν τότε χείμερος εἴη. Μείζονι δ’ ἂν χειμῶνι πυρώτερα φοινίσσοιτο.

palleat (ὠχρήσαι, Dios. 119), loses its bright colour and grows
dull. Luc. vi. 501 similarly of the moon, diris uerborum obsessa

dawn, iam sidera pallent Vz'cino turbata die.

237 It is doubtful whether uer prima iuuenta Cur ae. p. is
what the poet wrote. Par. and Esc. give primaque iuuenta
Ver ae. p„ which might point rather to cur prima iuuentae Ver
‹leslale peril, cur aestas zffisa senescit, in which cur would stand
at the beginning of each clause, uer aestate in marked anti-
thesis to each other. The corruption in C of cur twice into
curae is a sign of unusual vitiation. I have not ventured,
however, to alter the traditional reading.

fruges effcderit et mox Bruma recurrit iners.

cold parts about it; hence age, indolence, and similar qualities
(Hermippus de Astrol. pp. 18, 19, ed. Kroll, 1895). Scaliger
may thus be right in explaining tenax of the parsimonious
tendencies of old men; and so nearly Munm, who however
expands the idea to ‘ ill-natured ’ or ‘ malignant,' comparing Ter.

fenam. I prefer 8021le other explanation, ⁴ impediens, remorans‚’
obstructive‚ impeding action, or possibly stubborn, obstinate, as
Ovid speaks of tenacia fata, a destiny which kept a stubborn
grip upon him, Pont. i. 2. 63.

To Mars was assigned the gall-bladder (χολή) and the
choleric and pzqgrnacious propensities associated with it (Her-
mipp. p. 18) ; SO Herm. p. 38 μετὰ τοῦτο τὸ θυμοειδές τέτακται, δι’
οὗ τόλμα τε καὶ ὀργὴ καὶ θράσος εἴωθε γίνεσθαι· ἔχουσι δὲ καὶ ταῦτα
