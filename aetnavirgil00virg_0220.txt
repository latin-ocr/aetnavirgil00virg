For 190 Munro unhesitatingly follows C, and everything is in
its favour against Gyn: the sequence of presents docent—cogunt,
the absence of two rhyming terminations in the two halves of
the v. A line like Gyrsss Res oculos ducent, res ipsae credere
cogent is carefully avoided by the poet of Aetna.

Quin etiam tactu moneat contingere toto

Si liceat prohibent flammae custodiaque ignis

touch, if only contact with it were sase (tuto). But moneam
is more natural, and moneant, which vArzma'. agree to
give, would be a well-known mis-writing of it. Between
operum, the reading of all extant MSS„ operi of Gyr„ the
balance seems to be in favour of the genitive ε custodia operum
illi (Aetnae) ignis est; here custodia is ‘the guard‚’ not ‘the
guardianship‚' as often, Ov. M. viii. 69 aditus custodia seruat,
