COMMENTARY

137 iugera pessum
Intercepta.

I suspect the poet wrote Intersaepta, which would exactly
describe the appearance of ground after a landslip, blocked up
with fragments of rock at intervals. Rutilius Namatianus has,
I believe, the same word, i. 101 Intersaepla luis conduntur
flumina muris, where the MS. reading is Intercaepla. The
immediately following densaeque abscondita nocti (so CS with
the fifteenth century MSS.) is better than densaque abscondita
nocte (Cyn), as Munro and Alzinger agree. The locative is
like lateri abdidit ensem Aen. ii. 553, laterique recondere duro
Luctatur gladium Met. xii. 482, Vell. Paterc. ii. 91. 4 abdilus
carceri, cf. the recurring terrae. See Landgraf in Archiv fiir
latein. Lexl'kografilzl'e, viii. 69 sqq.

139 VVhatever is to be made of Gyrss Prospeclm'e chaos et sine
fine minas marg. uastum, whether the original had P. chaos
nassum et sine fine ruinas (Jacob) or ruinast (Munro), it
ought not to oust the clear and intelligible reading of CS
Rehd. v

Prospectare: procul chaos ac sine fine ruinae.
Allowed that minas has a genuine look which commands
respect, still what it means is uncertain. Again uastum,
which was unnoticed by the Jena editor of the Gyr. variants,
is stated by Matthiae to be in the margin: was it part
of the Gyr. tradition, or a later addition to complete the
imperfect line? I follow Alzinger in rejecting it; but dissent
from his interpretation of chaos as=cl2asma. chaos is merely
desolation, a scene of earth, rocks, and de'bris, spread con—
fusedly before the eye.

a lacuna.

Here the case sor Gyr. is much stronger: it is said to have
