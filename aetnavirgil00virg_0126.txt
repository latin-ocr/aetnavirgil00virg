of such workings baffles discovery3 only we know
that there is an efflux inside .............
will provide you with indubitable proofs of the nature
of the unknown deep. Do but let your mind guide
you to the understanding of nice investigations, and
abstract from the things you see your belief of the
unseen. For in such proportion as fire is always
more unrestrained‚ more furious, where the ground
is shut in3 in such proportion as the winds show
no less active fury under ground and far down,
in such proportion must both needs work wider
change, so much the more break their fastenings
loose, so much the more throw aside what stands in
their way. Yet the channels into which the violence
of air or flame escapes are not wrought in stubborn
matter with effort3 it rushes on only where what is
nearest gives way, and cuts its charmel slantwise where
it finds the enclosing barrier most frail. Hence
comes rocking and shakings of the earth, when the
close-pressed air stirs the open pores and pushes
the inert matter before it. But if earth were im-
permeable‚ if all its supporting frame were solid,
it would nowhere allow its marvellous operations to
be exhibited to the eye, but would be inert and,

packed as it is into a close heavy mass, immovable.
