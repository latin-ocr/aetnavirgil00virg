COMMENTARY

636 Dextra saeua tenus Darat, and so Haupt : Dextra saeua
tenent Scaliger, interpreting τὰ δεινὰ ἐκ δεξιῶν. Buecheler

C
makes Pietas nom. to tenet, allering ferunt to fertur. 637
fraterque Buecheler, and so ed. Paris. 1507 triumphant
Le Clerc. Mauro retained triumphans supposing after it ιι
lactina eff one verse. 638 illa is explained hy Buech. (ω’
Pietas, who is figured on Catz‘naean coins.

A very doubtful passage. Buecheler keeps tenet, sc. Pietas,
wh¹o cltecles the fierce flames on the right hand (dextra) and
on the left. Then fertur Ille fraterque tutus uterque pio sub
pondere. Illa (sc. Pietas) suffi‘cit: Piety is strong enough to
protect them.

The chief difficulty in this view is the remoteness of Pietas
as a subject to tenet: several nominatives intervene between
632 where Pietas is first mentioned and 636. Again fertur is

hardly a probable emendation of serziizt which C gives. Lastly,
ifsuffi‘cit is genuine, its natural meaning would be, ‘is able to
support the burden,' as Seneca writes (ad Polyb. iii) siff’cit ille
huic sarcinae. I have preferred Baehrens’ conj. sustitit.

Here saeua must be constructed with incendia, tenent =
durant, ‘last on,' ‘hold out,’ sor which sense Lachmann and
Munro on Lucr. vi. 519 cite a great many parallels, especially
from Livy.

obliquos means that the fire slants aside and does not meet
the brothers with the full front of its flames.

illa (adverb) is explained by pio sub pondere: ‘tlzere‚ where
the pious burden (of the father and mother) is carried, and
round the twain.' Ael. fr. 2 τὸ γάρ τοι πῦρ θεόντων αὐτῶν διέστη
καθ’ ὃ μέρος ἐκεῖνοι παρεγίνοντο. Munro makes‘illa the mother,
who holds out (szcffi‘cit) in spite of her terror.

640 Menrad, Archiv fiir Latein. Lexikogr. 1887, p. 506,
shows that incolumis abire is a savourite combination from
Cato onwards. He cites Livy, Curtius, Frontinus, Val. Maximus,
and the Latin Anthology.

tandem, a common-place touch which betrays the imperfect
art of the writer, on which point see Sonntag‚ Vergil als
Bucolisclcer Dichter, p. 235.
