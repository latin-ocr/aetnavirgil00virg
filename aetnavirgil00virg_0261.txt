COMMENTARY

that he gave it a different sense. Serv. expressly condemns
those who read recessus in Aen. xi. 5273 here receptus can
hardly be said to be pronouncedly right or wrong, and as such
1 retain it. [Fore. indeed states that the two words are found
frequently interchanged 3 but though recessus may have sup-
planted receptus in not a few cases, it seems dangerous to assume
that the former word can be substituted for it ad libitum and
against MSS]

336 uidet, ‘has no eye for,’ ‘takes no heed of.’ In thesourn.
ofPlcilology for 1887, p. 302, 1 defended this as right, and Ι see
that Sudhaus retains it; it would fall under the tendency to
personisjt natural objects, which Hildebrandt notices as charac-
terizing the poem.

337 One of the poet’s happiest lines. The rhythm admirably
expresses the rapid changes of position which the cloud assumes.

338-9 This is a distinct assertion ofa custom which we learn
also from Pausanias iii. 23. 9 of the craters of Aetna being fre-
quented by worshippers. The poet says they offered incense:
Paus. says they let down into thern (εἷς τοὺς κρατῆρας ἀφιᾶσι)
victims of all kinds, as well as things made of gold or silver.
From placantes it might seem that this was done after an erup-
tion, or when an eruption was expected. Frazer, in his note on
the passage, rejects the view that Paus. confuses the crater of
Aetna with the naphtha lakes of the Palici ; and illustrates such
offerings to the volcano from the modern custom of the
Hawaiians. ‘ In Hawaii vast numbers of hogs used to be thrown
into the craters of the great volcano Kirauea during an eruption,
or when an eruption was threatening: hogs, too, were cast into
the rolling tide of lava to appease the gods and stay its prog-ress.²
