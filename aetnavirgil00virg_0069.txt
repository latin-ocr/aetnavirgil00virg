THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA'

at intervals from 1887 to the present time. Very lately
Alzinger has subjected all these variants to a laborious and
impartial scrutiny, and the result may be stated in his own
words. ‘The codex Gyraldinus has played out its role as
“best source.’' As basis for the formation of the text
of Aetna, CS alone can count henceforward, however cor-
rupt and disfigured their transmission, and however hard
· their riddles to explain.'

Lilius Gyraldus (Hist. Poet. iv. p. 372, ed. Basel‚ 1545)
in his life of the poet Claudian writes thus: ‘ Composuit
uero mulla Claudianus quae in manibus habentur, inter quae
et nonnulla Graeca, ut Gigmntomackiam, ex qua et Graecos
uersus legy'mus . . . Extant et Claudiam· in Graecorum
epigrammatum uolumine de crystallo uersus qua de re
eiusdem et Latini leguntur. Extat item de Aetna monte,
quod an ipsius legitimum sit nec probare nec refellere ausim.
ex antiquissimo certe et castigato codice qui Fra ncz'sci Petrarckae
fuisse creditur, illud ego lpse exscripsi)

From this it would seem that among the poems ascribed
to Claudian were some in Greek, a ngantomachia, and an
epigram on a crystal 5 and that there was also extant with
the same ascription a poem on Mount Aetna, which Gyraldus
had copied with his own hand from a correct and very
ancient MS.‚ which was believed to have once been in the
possession of Petrarch. He does not say that this was
a MS. of Claudian ,· but this is a reasonable inference from
his statement. For in all the earliest MSS. of the poem,
whether entire or in excerptS, with which we are acquainted
it is ascribed to Vergil, and to Vergil only: if therefore
Gyraldus attributed it, though doubtfully, to Claudian, it
must have been an inference from its inclusion in a volume
containing other works of that poet.
