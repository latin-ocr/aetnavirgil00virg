AETNA

To either view there are strong objections. The word Euocat
would hardly be combined with the ablative canoris z‘n sz'luz's;
an accus. would be expected, as Haupt emended, canoras
in siluas, which however has no support from MSS. and is
arbitrary. Moreover to supply sororem to Euocat from the
following words is a mere makeshift; to supply Ityn is so far
from easy or natural, that I have nowhere found anything to
support it in the various records of the legend.

In 1887 (soum. cffPlzilology, p. 311) Ι wrote: ‘ For Euocat z’n
I would write Plorat (It)yn. A similar depravation attaches to
this unfortunate name in Cul. 252 Quarum uox Ilyn edit Ityn,
which the oldest MS. (Bembo’s) presents in this strange shape,
Quarum uox z't in edyzyn!

But how, it will be asked, could Philomela, when she had
lost her tongue, bewail Itys in the woods or take her part in
the songs of the birds that sing there1? The answer to this
is very simple. The nightingale is thought of apart from the
details of the tragic story which preceded. Catull. lxv. 13, 14
Qualia sub densis ramorum concinit umbris Daulias absumpti
fieta canens Ityle2'2.

My suggestion has the merit (1) of harmonizing with canoris.
The nightingale bears her part in the general song of the woods.
(2) It is a well-known fact of palaeography that the first and
last words of a line are specially liable to corruption, hence
Euocat for Plorat has nothing to surprise. (3) Ityn has
occasioned a similar confusion elsewhere. (4) The introduction
of the name adds to the poetic completeness of the passage: we
thus have three of the actors in the tragedy, Philomela, Itys,
Tereus. (5) Plorat is the right word for a woman's lamentation
over a lost kinsman or lover. Reyfferscheid Sueton. p. 252
mulieres orbae plorant: and so Tib. ii. 6. 42 ; Prop. iii. 12. 1.

587 Tereus ferus: Ov. M. vi. 549 feri {yrcmnm 581 saeui
matrona tyranni. ,

589 This verse seems to be partially imitated by Maxim. ν.

¹ Hildebrandt‚ Beitrc‘r'ge‚ p. 4 quotes Lucr. i. 256 Frondifirasque
nouis auibus cancre undique siluas. Verg. G. ii. 328 resonant auibus
uirgulta canoris. Plin. iv. 31 Penius . . . canorus auium concentu.

² Here too the name Itylei is disguised in many MSS. as Protlm'.
