COMMENTARY

Vix tamen eripiam posito panone uelis quin Hoc potius quam
gallina tergere palatum, the meaning is, ‘ you would take from
me the belief’3 ‘I shall hardly take from you a preference for
peacock.’ Again, the position of et, and the change of eripi-
antur to eripient et, are both improbable. Nor is testantur or
rumpuntur likely to have become eripiantur.

Sudh. translates, ‘And in proof that this material penetrates
far into the heart of the mountain, let an experiment be made
by drawing off (or, up) some of the tainted water at the
bases Such a sense of eripiantur is not supported by Vitruv.
viii. 2. 5 ex omnibus terris (uenti) lambentes eripiunt umores,
nor by Plat. Tim. 60 ὑπὸ πυρὸς τάχους πᾶν τὸ νοτερὸν ἐξαρπασθέν ;
in both the sense of subtracting, in the latter with violence,
something which properly belongs to an object, is quite clear;
of which in the passage of Aetna there can be no notion.
eripiantur, if genuine, ought to mean, ‘ be carried forcibly
away'3 suggesting difficulty and a struggle ¹. The nearest
approach to the sense assigned by Sudhaus that Ι can find is in
Claudian‘s Hystrix xlv. 36 (p. 291 Birt) Eripiunt trucibus
Gortynia capris Cornua merely = ‘they remove.’ But, to say
nothing of the late date of this poem, the notion of violence is
not absent, as the epithet trucibus seems to show.

In Journ. ofPltilology, 1887, p. 304, I conjectured crispantur,
‘ ripple‚’ a word particularly used of water. ‘ Crispari eleganter
dicitur aqua, cum breuioribus undis quasi trepidat. Hinc crispi
undarum motus, Auson. Mosell. v. 194, eodem fere modo et
arenam crispari dicit, v. 63. Minue. Fel. c. 3 Et ut semper
mare, etiam positis flatibus, inquietum est, etsi non canis spumo-

,sisquefluctibus exibat ad terram, tamen crispis torosisque (tor-
tuosisque, P. Daniel) ibidem erroribus delectati perquam sumus,'
de Rooy, Spicileg. Crit. 1771.

The infin. discurrere depends κατὰ σύνεσιν on a suppressed
verb latent in crispantur. Parallel uses of loosely attached
infin. are not uncommon in Lucretius, ii. 1128 Nam certe fluere
atque recedere corpora rebus lllulta manus dandumst3 iii. 765

¹ So in Vitruv. ii. 6. 3 ab ignis uelzementt'a e tofo terraque, quem·
admodum in fornacibus ex calce, ita ex his ereptum esse liquor-em, the
sense is that the liquid has been forcibly withdrawn.
