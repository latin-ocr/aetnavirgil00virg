COMMENTARY

xx, ut plane trecentorum Lacedaemoniorum apud Thermopylas
gloriam adaequarent.

The chief objection to this otherwise convincing interpreta-
tion is that the verse more naturally suggests the ἱερὸς λόχος of
Thebes, which was also three hundred in number. See Plutarch,
Pelopidas xviii3 Grote‚ Hist. Greece, vi. 531. But the Theban
sights and legends are brought to an end with 577 ; nor is any
transposition ¹ of the verse in question (579) at all likely.

It might also be urged that the introduction of a historical
fact like the Three Hundred at Thermopylae is the only excep-
tion to the mythological character of all the other legends
mentioned by the poet.

580 spectantur recalls such uses as Micon athletis spectatur
(Plin. xxxiv. 88), al1nost=is appraised by his Athletes, xxxv. 20
non est spectata (the art of painting) honestis manibus: cf.
Hildebrandt, Beitrage, p. 8.

581 soli uictrice lllz'nerua. In the contest between Athena
and Poseidon, Athena's olive conquered Poseidon’s salt-water
pool, and gave her possession os the Attic territory. Herod. viii.
55 ἔστι ἐν τῇ ἀκροπόλι ταύτῃ Ἐρεχθέος τοῦ γηγενέος λεγομένου εἶναι
νηός, ἐν τῷ ἐλαίη τε καὶ θάλασσα ἔνι· τὰ λόγος παρὰ Ἀθηναίων
Ποσειδέωνά τε καὶ Ἀθηναίην, ἐρίσαντας περὶτῆς χώρηςῖμαρτύρια θέσθαι.
See Grote, Hisa ofGreece, i. p. 266.

soli of C seems right against sua of the later MSS.; sua
would refer to Athena, whom Athens might in a special sense
claim as her own.

584—587 are thus written in C:

Tu quoque Athenarum carmen tam nobile sidus
Erigone sedes uestra est phylomella canoris
Euocat insiluis etta soror hospita tectis
Acciperis solis tereus serus exulat agris.
