AETNA

110 uetustas Haupt 111 Haec Sv: Nec Arund. sed
S Rchd. v intrat S wlziclz Bormam would restore 112 Et
fugiens Bormans molitus S : molitur Rehd.v iter Rekd. v
114 uicere Sevin fudere Asunro.

If Haec of CS in 111 is retained, sed must be an error for seu
‘ whether it (Le. the earth with its hollow conforrnation) has a cause
of ancient standing, and this (cavernous) appearance came to it
at birth, or whether (seu for sed) it is that a free current of air
makes,its way in (intrat), and in escaping (Etsugz'ens) works
itself a passage? On the other hand, Nec of Arund. harmonizes
better with sed, ‘whether its cause is ancient, yet its porosity
did not come to it at birth, but air found its way in at some
later time ¹ ’3 so Munro.

It is remarkable how often C has given uidere when some
other verb is either required or expected. In 77 uiderunt is
doubtful : in 336 uidet is open to suspicion: here uidere cannot
be right, though found in all MSS. Between Sevin's uicere
and Munro's fudere there is not much to choose in point of
meaning, the heat might equally well overpower orsuse the solid
with which it conflicts; but palaeographically the change to
uicere is more common and easy: hence I have preferred the
conj. of Sevin, which goes back to 1729.

116 non est hic causa dolendi

Dum stet opus causae. CS. ’

116 dolendi MSS: docendi Ald. and Mzcnro: docenda
L) Clerc, and so Lachmann on Lucr. vi. 755 117 causas
Aszmro.

Le Clerc illustrates stet from Cic. Fam. ix. 2. 5 modo nobis stet
sllud, una uiuere in stlgdz’is nostris. As there stet is constructed
with a dat. nobis, so here with causae: ‘ we have no cause to
complain, if only the effect is constant to its cause? If the cause
is found to produce its effect persistently, that is enough to
content us: we need not fret that we cannot fathom the exact
method of nature’s workings. Neither docendi nor docenda is
required: it is vexing to have to confess ignorance, hence

dolendi. Causa is used in two different senses, somewhat feebly
¹ ὀῑ, as suggested in the Translation, ‘or it may be that its cause is

only ancient, and this appearance is nothing congenital, but} διε.
