πῦρ ἐπελθὸν κρανέει (-εῖ Diels) καὶ καταλήψεται, ‘will try and
condemn!

539 Seminium, ‘stock‚' a Lucretian word. Munr. on Lucr.
iii. 741. Serv. on Geor. i. 86 Sequitur Heracliti opinionem qui
dicit omnia ex lgni procreari.

540 solido uicina: nearly solid, next door to solid, as we say.
The verse is metrically very effective.

541 animos, ‘determination,' ‘stubbornness’z so patere extor-
quere animos, 404.

542 plumbi of MSS. is defended by Hildebrandt 3 the norni-
native would be zgm's. So in 404 exue robur is said of the
person wlco submz‘ts the stone to fire, and so strips it of its sub-
stance ; and so Aen. viii. 567 totidem exuit armis. [Generally
however Vergil, our poet’s chief model of style, uses exuere
of the person or thing that doffs or puts off from z'tself, e. g.
Exuerint (the trees will put off) siluestrem animum, G. ii. 51,
and so in seven other passages ]

544 suspensis, pendent or high hung, because the smelting·
funnel was raised to some height from the floor. The use of
suspensio, suspensura, of the flooring of baths‚ as being suspended
over the flues of a furnace upon low pillars (pilae) is very
similar, Vitruv. ν. 10. 2, Sen. Epist. 90. 25, Rich, Companion,
p. 634. Ovid calls the fornax profunda, M. ii. 229.

545 Exsua'ant, ‘ sweat out their value,² i. e. discharge under
the pressure of a furnace-fire what gives them value. Plin.
xxxiii. 6ο altera causa preti maior quod minimum usus deterit,
another reason why gold is so valuable. With Exsudant cf.
VitruV. vii. 11. 4 simul aes et ea harena ab {gnis uehementia
c<074fc‘rzeescend0 coaluerint, inter se dando et acctpiendo sudores
ιι proprietalibus (cf. 512) discedunt, where sudores are the tran-
sudations of the two substances (aes and harena) produced by
a furnace-fire.

profundo, as in 257. Gray's Full many a gem ospurest ray
serene T lte darle mzfullzom'd caves (gf Ocean bear looks like an
imitation ; if so, he must have thought profundo referred to the
deep sea.

546 sorte. The abl. aster obnoxius is found in the Digest, and
the occasional use of the genitive also proves that it was normal.
