fluids? Hence, as I do not believe our poet could use a Lucre-
tian diction in a non-Lucretian sense, Ι follow Munro in adopting
De Rooy’s conj. Torpentes, a word which fitly describes the
torpid and motionless state of the air when the water breaks
in upon and dislodges it. pulsata denset = pulsat et denset.

292-4

Nam ueluti sonat ora duc tritone cancro
Pellit opes collectus aquae uictusque mouere
Spiritus et longas emugit bucina uoces. C.

292 sonat ora diu tritona canoro leehd. and Arx: sonatura
dius tritona canoro v, whence I conj. sonat urna ciens Tritona
canorum. Mauro conj. hora duci, and so Hz'ldebrandt. s. hora
die or lacus Haupt 293 opus the Helmstadt MS. m. pr.
moueri seems lo be required.

Another very doubtful passage. Ora is generally taken as
hora, with which die (from diu) might seem to accord, if it
could be shown that the trumpeting Triton was part of a
mechanical device for indicating time. If duc of C best repre—
sents the manuscript tradition, Munro's duci is very near: he
explained duci either of the commanding officer in a naumachia
such as Claudius exhibited on lake Fucinus, or of the Roman
Emperor himself. Hildebrandt‚ Bez‘trc'zge p. 16, thinks Claudius
(Suet. Claud. 21, Plin. xxxiii. 63) is meant; both Statius and
Martial use cl‘z'cx of the princeps3 for the dative Hild. cites
Plin. viii. 22 pugnauere et Caesari dictatori . . . xx (elephanti)
cantra pedites D. But ora can hardly mean the shore of the
lake where the sharn sea—fight took place, as Hild. goes on
to suggest3 nor is lacus for duc or diu a probable alteration.

Hora would be less strange in the sense of the hour when
llzefiglcl was lo begz'n3 this would suit with duci, not as=princtp23
but as ‘ presiding officer.’ The abl. Tritone canoro nearly = per
canorem Tritonis; the position oscanoro at the end ofthe ν. shows
it to be the determining word. We might then translate : ‘just
as the hour of battle is sounded to the general by the trumpeting
tones of the Triton.’ Another explanation is suggested by Vitruv.
ix. 8 (9). 6, where he describes some of Ctesibius' automatic
machines, including chronometers (horologia). The hours were
marked on a column or from-wall, and each successively indi-
