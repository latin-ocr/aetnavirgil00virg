COMMENTARY

and of clouds that spread out like branches‚ vi. 133: but it may
also be an error for raris, agreeing with a lost foraminibus in
the following verse; or again icta ramis may possibly be a
perversion of acta rimis; for, as Le Clerc long ago pointed out,
rimas agere = ‘to crack‚’ ‘split open,’ is regular. Ov. M. ii.
21 1 Fissaque agit rimas (tellus), x. 512 Arbor agit rimas.

[Sudhaus, accepting 460-462 as correctly given by MSS. and
continuous, explains: ‘ For as soon as the lava-stone sets its
powers in motion and threatening disturbance flies off and draws
with it the ground following its initiative (exemplo), as well
as the substances struck upon by its branching veins.’ On this
view icta is accus. plur. neuter3 ramis = ῥάβδοις, ‘veins in the
stone,' Theophr. de caus. plant. iv. 12. 6, and so in the fragm.
de lapid.; and the apodosis begins at 463 Tum pauidum
jugera] ·

462 graue murmur. Brydone‚ T our in Sicily, p. 93, speaks
of the heavy dull bellowing of the mountain. γ

demonstrat could not be ‘exhibits’ with murmur, {grtes as
object accusatives: they are nominatives, and demonstrat has
its proper sense of indicating or signaling.

463 sacris, supernatural ; 50 diuinis rebus, 369. Lucan x. 198
has sacras leges of the divine ordinances which the Nile obeys.

464 as given in C,

Parere et tuto speculaberis omnia collis
(and so Rehd. but with 4- appended in the right margin to mark
that the verse was wrong), cannot be certainly restored. Parere
may be, as Scaliger thought, Par erit, or, as Sudhaus conj„ Par
rere. Again‚ et may be e as Scal. thought, or ex as Ι prefer:
collis may depend on θα) tuto or be an error for colli.

1. Par rere (Sudhaus) for parere is very near the MS. and
the spondaic elision in -re at this part of the verse would have
many parallels in Lucr., e.g. i. 608 haerere unde queant, 846
errare atque illz·; ii. 10 Errare atque uz'am3 iv. 1148 exire et
ualidos. Against it is to be put the fact that par est, uidetur,
or some other verb in the 3rd pers. sing.‚ seems the norm.
An imperative, if found at all, is exceptional.

2. et is constantly interchanged with ex, as perhaps in 430.
See my Noct. Manil. pp. 4, 10, 35 ; and in Sen. de Ira, ii. 29. 2
