AETNA

not that Aetna, being close by, supplied it secretly
with its own substances and material, or drove the
winds through some sunken pipe to and fro, and gave
aliment to the fire.

F act, however, meets us with a better voucher than
any mere sign, and with the test of real proofs: fact
makes no attempt to misrepresent a witness. For
all round the flanks and at the lowest base of Aetna
are white-hot stones discharging heat, and loose-
scattered rocks with smouldering pores, enough to
make you believe, as a fact of sight, that it is the
lava-stone which is the aliment and cause of burning z
and when this is scanty the fires it gets together
are starved. The flames once got in, it discharges
thern, and in doing so kindles by its impact
other material, forcing this to melt with it in one
flame. It is, indeed, no wonder that the effects
we see outside Aetna should teem as they do:
the volcanic action, if toned down, is still unspent:
the stronger burning of the lava, its more potent
solicitation of adjoining combustibles, its infallible
premonitions of a coming conflagration are in the
otlzer centre, within the crater. As soon as [the
mountain] sets its forces in motion and after threaten-
ing turmoil ....... (lamma) [the earth] flies
asunder and in an instant pulls the soil away3
whereupon convulsed through its branching pores
[Aetna trembles] and a deep rumbling under ground
