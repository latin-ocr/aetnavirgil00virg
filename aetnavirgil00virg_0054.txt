PROLEGOMENA

This makes the mother of the Palici Thalia, an Aetnean
nymph. Macrobius (v. 18. 18) knows her only as nympha
lealz'a with no mention of Aetna. But in other, and
earlier, accountS, Palicus is the son, not of an Aetnean
nymph, but of Aetna herself3 thus Servius on Aen. ix. 581
Aetnam nympha-m, uel ut quidam uolunt Thaliam, Iuppiter
cum uitiasset et ficisset grauidam, timens Iunonem, secundnm
alios ipsam puellam terrae commendauit, et illic enixa est:
secandum alios partum eius: ibid. alii Vulcani et Aetnae
filium tradunt (Palicum). Steph. Byz. s.v. Παλική quotes
a writer called Silenus as stating that Palicus' mother was
Aetna, daughter of Oceanus. Placidus on Stat. Theb. xii.
156 calls her ‘a nymph Aetna.'

In the Theocritean Scholia on i. 65, two distinct sets
of parents are assigned to Aetna, (1) Uranus and Ge, (2)
Briareos, the father also of Sicanus. It seems probable that
there were other genealogies now lost, which like the Briareos
pedigree, connected her with Chthonic or Titanic powers.
Among such Perses or Persaeus is a well-known and
recurring name, Hes. Theog. 375—377 :—

Κρείῳ δ’ Εὖρυβίη τέκεν ε’ν φιλότητι μιγεῖσα
Ἀστραῖόν τε μέγαν Πάλλαντά τε δῖα θεάων
Πέρσην θ’, ὃς καὶ πᾶσι μετέπρεπεν ἰδμοσύνῃσιν.

Cf. Apollod. i. 1. 2.

It may be said that Perseis is usually the name of
Hecate, e. g. in Hesiod's Theogony and in the Argonautica
of Apollonius Rhodius, This does not prove that there
were no other claimants to the same title. Hyginus Fab.
156 mentions a Perseis, d. of Oceanus, and mother of
Circe3 cf. Apollod. i. 9. 1. Aetna (Steph. Byz. l.c.) was

said by Silenus to be herself a daughter of Oceanus 5 it
