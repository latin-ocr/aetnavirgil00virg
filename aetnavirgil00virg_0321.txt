COMMENTARY

arcano, ‘ secret,’ ‘mysterious‚’ suits the poet⁷s conception
of Aetna, as a centre of marvellous supernatural operations.
‘ Omnia quae uim sacram et diuinam quamdam habere crede·
bantur, Poetis arcana dici solent.' Burmann. So Val. Fl. iv. 15
arcano redolentem nectare florem Quem penes alta quies liqui·
dique potentia somni. Tac. Ann. ii. 54 hausta fontes arcani aqua.

557 Sed non qui nostro seruet. Munro shows that this is
a recurring form of diction in Seneca. Epist. 64. 1 Inleruenerant
quidam amici, propter quos maior ficmus fieret, non hic qui
erumpere ex lautorum culinis et terrere uzgriles solet, sed hic
modicus, qui hospites uenisse significet. Pers. v. 73 Libertate
opus est non lzac qua ut quisque Velina Publius emeruit, scabio-
sum tesserula far Possidet.

558 caelo, compendious for caeli igni.

560 adstrictis saucibus, literally in Tac. Ann. iv. 70 of a man
whose throat is tightened. Here the narrow openings of the
mountain are adstrictae, ‘confined ’ or ‘ compressed.’

561 contendere, ‘to match themselves against,' as in a contest
of strength, in which the ore will show a stubborn resistance.

563 Exanimant, ⁴ empty the bellows of their air’ ε Forcellini
quotes no other instance of this sense.

nentrum of C (= uentum) is obviously right against uentos
of the later MSS„ since the wind in the bellows is one and
the same, not a number of different winds. agmine here os the
body of wind formed by the pressure of successive puffs of
the bellows. πυκνῷ συστρέμματι might represent presso agmine.

564 forma, the conjecture of Christian Wolf sorsama of MS S„
must be right: the poet, after his detailed account of the causes
of Aetna's eruptions, sums up ‘ This is the process of the work,'
not ‘this is what is said ² of it. Velleius ii. 66 has formam
operis=the design of my history.

sic nobilis uritur Aetna of Rehd. Ar. is here right against the
older tradition of C, ignobilis utitur Aetna.

565 foraminibus shows that the poet is thinking mainly of
air, which is once more clearly distinguished from spiritus.

565, ⁵66

Terra foraminibus uires trahit urguet (sic) in artum
Spiritus incendi uiuit per maxima saxa. C.
