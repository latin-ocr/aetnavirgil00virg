PROLEGOMENA

written in the tenth century) and acquainted with many
of its readings', had only an imperfect knowledge of the
MS. as a whole.

Twelve years later, when Ribbeck was preparing his
edition of the Vergilian opuscula, he wrote to Munro asking
for a collation of the text of the Culex, contained in the
same MS„ Kk. v. 34. Munro sent his collation to Ribbeck,
and then proceeded to examine the Aetna portion of the
MS. A comparison of its readings with those of the MSS.
previously known (the chief of them were published by
Jacob in his edition of 1826) was enough to prove its
immense superiority. This, indeed, might have been
inferred from its much greater antiquity: for it cannot be
later than the tenth century. Munro accordingly collated
it completely, and published his collation with a commentary
in 1867.

If to this Munro had merely added the readings, as
reported by the Iena editor and Matthiae, of the lost codex
Gyraldinus (vv. 138—285), it is probable that his edition
would have made a greater mark, and would have been
received with more enthusiasm. But the later MSS. which
Munro included in his apparatus criticus are all of the
fifteenth century, and all more or less interpolated; and
the eye of the reader wanders amongst their' unimportant
variants, and cannot keep C (the Cambridge MS.) in view
unobstructedly. In spite of this Munro's complete publica-
tion of C for the first time, marks the beginning of a more
exact criticism on Ael72a3 for however useful the com-
mentaries of earlier editors like Scaliger, Le Clerc, Wernsdorf,
Jacob, may be in explaining or illustrating its difficulties,
these editors could not constitute a satisfactory text, because
