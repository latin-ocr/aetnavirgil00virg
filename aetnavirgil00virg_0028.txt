PROLEGOMENA

the seventy-ninth Epistle of the younger Seneca, where,
talking of poetica] descriptions of Etna, he says: ‘this
commonplace of poetry, even after it had been handled
by Ovid, and more perfectly by Vergil, was fearlessly
attempted again by Corn. Severus' (79. 5). Scaliger
approved this ascription, and it was generally¹ accepted
till Wernsdorf in the fourth volume of his Poetae Latini
*Minores (1785) proposed a new candidate. This was
Lucilius Junior, the friend and correspondent of Seneca.
Wernsdorf's view was admitted by Jacob in his edition of
Aetna (1826), by Haupt, and by Munro (1867), and is
the prevailing view of the present time. I must not omit
to mention Caspar Barth's theory that it was written by
Manilius.

Fisteen years after Munro's edition had appeared, a Hun-
garian named Kruczkiewicz, published a dissertation, in
which he rejected the theories of post-Augustan authorship.
He reverts to the old belief that Vergil was the author of
Aetna. Two of his arguments may be mentioned: (1) we
know from Suetonius’ Life that Vergil was often in Cam-
pania and Sicily, and must have had many opportunities
of observing both Vesuvius and Aetna3 (2) Apelles' picture
of Venus Anadyornene, which the writer of Aetna (592—8)
includes in the objects of art men travelled abroad to see,

¹ But not universally. Tanaquil Faber (Tannegui Le Fevre), on
Scn. Snasor. ii. writes ‘ Huiusne Corn. Seueri sit carmen de Aetna
quod Virgilio quidam tribuunt, dubitari potest.' Le Fevre also
anticipatos the view of Wernsdorf, Munro, and Wagler that the
passage in Seneca's seventy-ninth Epistle refers, not to a separate
poem on Aetna, but to an Episode. Caspar Barth was equally
sceptical as to Corn. Severus (Adv. xxxii. 16), and atone time
thought a Christian, at another Manilius, the author. See the¹
citations in Wcrnsdors, pp. 61-63.
