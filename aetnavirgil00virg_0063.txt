THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA'

569 Traducti materia et terris per proxima fatis C

Traducti maria, the conj. of De Rooy, is simple and
generally accepted as right.

Relzd. gives Tracti materia, which is a step towards the
more complete vitiation which is found in some late
fifteenth-century MSS„ e. g. MS. 207 in the Museum of
N aples, Traduce materia.

Another test of the superiority of C is orthography. 1t
has artus arte not arctus, arcte, caelum not coelum, temptare
not tentare, nequiquam not nequicquam, Iuppiter not Iupiter,
harena not arena, saecula not secula, sucosz'or not succosior,
bucina not buccina, sz'pom'bus not slsph07zz'bzts‚ z'm'ce not iniice,
cometen not cometem, Bootes not Boethes, Laeda not Leda.
Not that it is without spellings of less authority: even C
has not escaped that predominant error of MSS. nggus
for Lycurgus, and so lzunu'da, extinctus instead of the rnore
correct umida, exstinctus 1. Some few traces of st for est
aster -cze have survived, luna . est=lu7uzest 2 30, terrent for
terraest 387.

Among the fifteenth-century MSS. there is little to choose.
The Relcdiger codex, which Ι have published in full in the
Journal of Plcilology, xx. 207-223„ is a fair representative
of them3 Vat. 3272, containing 1-433‚ has some readings
of its own which deserve consideration, yet as a whole is
deplorably corrupt. Still these MSS. are not to be entirely
neglected‚ as they contain occasional lections which are
obviously right, and it cannot be demonstrated that these
are all corrections of Italian scholars of the Renaissance.
Those who are familiar with the transmission of classical

¹ Yet exsudant (545). In 269 dolen is shown by Munro to be
a correct form : ptjgnera 135, but ptjgnora, pignore 459, 518.
