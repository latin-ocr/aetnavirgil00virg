them in the grave of its jaws, or else they flow in
secret with close caverns above thern, and issuing to
light at a distance, renew their course unexpectedly.
Indeed, were it not that the earth throws off canals
here and there, and a water-track gives housing to the
river, springs and streams would assuredly be without
their required channel, and the sluggish earth would
be packed close into a solid mass, and its motionless
weight keep it from working. But if rivers there
be which are buried in sheer abysses of earth, if there
be others that aster burial come to light again, certain
others that spring to life with no such previous burial,
it is not strange if pent up winds also have free vents
that escape the eye. Earth will furnish you with suc-

vouchers which cannot but arrest your eye. Often
you may look out upon huge gaps in the ground and
stretches of land cut off and fallen in ruin or plunged
