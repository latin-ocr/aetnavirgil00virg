COMMENTARY

is that coactus elsewhere seems to be singular=‘compulsion,'
‘compelling force,' and is not used in the sense of ‘condensa-
tions.’ Lucr. ii. 273 Viribus alterius magnis magnaque coactu,
⁴ strong compulsion ’ (Munro) : and so in Cicero. If coactus as
nom. pl. is thought hazardous, the choice seems to lie between
coactis (sc. causis), ‘ by these causes, pressed into united service
outside and within, the work is done‚’ or coactu, ‘by their
compelling force they (sc. causae) set the winds in motion!
Between coactis and coactu, the poet's fondness for a pause
after the trochee of the fifth font, and a certain harshness in
the abruptness of Exagz‘tant uentos, if it begins the verse,
appear to me to decide the point in favour of coactu.

[Munro’s coactos cannot well be constructed with penitusque
alone (His α. c. extra, penitusque coactos Exagitant uentos),
which dislocates the verse and gives coactos a somewhat
vague meaning]

317 agitur impersonal, ‘the business is done.’ Aen. vii. 523
non iam slipitibus duris agitur, and cf. the legal formula agitur
de lzac re, qno de agitur, qua de re agitur (Nettleship).

318 Exagitant‚ sc. causae. So 369 egestas, 602 Izippiter> 180
mons and elsewhere (Hildebrandt). - ’

pugnant, sc. uenti. arte with Pugnantis nearly = in arto.

The writer of the Ibis has praefocare (558), Florus (fflcare.
profundo, abl. after exhausta, the preposition in which has its
full force.

320 perbibit: another word of the Ibis (231), ‘has absorbed
completely.' Also of Seneca.
