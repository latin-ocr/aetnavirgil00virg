COMMENTARY

and 458-460 deus illam molliter aram
Lambit et ipse suos ubi contigit ignis honores
Defugit ab sacris rursumque reconditur antro;
a description which must refer to a lower part of the moun-
tain.

, Esther, therefore, the poet of Aetna does not refer to these
rites at all, or the connexion of them with 328-354 is obscured
by the corruption of the MSS„ which is specially palpable at
this part of the poem]

357—364 XVhether the cause, then, is external or inward‚
it is this impetuous air which hurls up the inside of the volcanO,
boulders, sand, and huge rocks, that clash against each other
as they rise and produce a terrific din.

357 propriz‘sue Scaliger, for propriisque of MSS.

potentis of C and Relzd. is retained by Munro, though a
nominative (not accusative) plural. Neue-VVagener have col-
lected a considerable number of similar instances‚ Formenl. ii.
p. 119, notably from Lucr.‚ uisentis plangentis duplicis auentis
pascentis plorantis labentis quatientis uolantis, and some few
from Vergil. Alzinger and Hildebrandt thinkfbrlis in 624 is
such a nom. plur.

360 trepidantia, ‘quaking or shivering with the encounter,'
i.e. starting off from each other with a vibrating and convulsive
motion. But strepitantia, or crepitantia as Jacob conj„ may
be right. I prefer the former ; Ov. M. xi. 364 Inde fragore
graui strepitus loca proxima terret Belua uasta lupus.

fragoris,·accus. plur. after rumpunt (Munro, Hild.). The
latter compares rumpere uocem, questus (Aen. ii. 129, iv. 553).

362-364 Scal. traces this simile of trees taking fire by the attri-
tion of their boughs to Thuc. ii. 77. 4 ἤδη ’γὰρ ἐν ὅρεσιν ὕλη
τριφθεῖσα ὑπ’ α’νέμων πρὸς· αὐτὴν ἀπὸ ταύτωμάτου πῦρ καὶ φλόγα ἀπ’
αὐτοῦ ἀνῆκε. It occurs twice in Lucretius i. 897 At saepe in
magnis fit montibus, inquis, ut altis Arboribus uicina cacumina
summa terantur Inter se, ualidis fircere id cogentibus austris,
Donec flammai fulserunt flore coorto, ν. 109 5—1 100.

362 prono, ‘descending,' nearly =1<ara<rxrj7rronw Alzinger
quotes Lucr. vi. 560 Incumbit tellus quo uenti prona premit uis.

363 aquilone, Hor. C. ii. 9. 7 (Wernsdorf).
