THE MSS. OF ‘AETNA’

this Ernst was. It is generally supposed that he is the
Henr. Ernstius who in 1641 published a one vol. Catalogue
of the Laurentian Library. Munro, however, could find
no reference in this Catalogue to the Florentine codex
from which the Gyraldinian extracts‚ as just mentioned,
are said to have been drawn3 nor could I. Still the date
of this Ernst (1603-1665), and his familiarity with the MSS.
of the Laurentian Library, would agree with this identifica-
tion3 and the short and incomplete character of his
Catalogue might account sor the omission of the MS. in
question ; or it might have been passed over as a mere
fragment. At any rate no such MS„i. e. no MS. containing
Aetn. 138-285 in full, or the excerpted variants published
as Gyraldinian a century later, was known to Bandini when
he issued his complete Catalogue of the Laurentian Library
(1764-1778l

This is the more wonderful because Bandini does mention
a fifteenth century MS. of that library (33. 9), the first folio
of which begins with Aetn. 270—285, i. e. the concluding
sixteen verses of the very fragment of which Ernst is said
to have had a copy taken from a ‘Codex Florentinus)
What is more, this fragment agrees in a remarkable manner
with the Gyraldinian readings as publ-ished in 1756 and
1797 from a copy of Pithou's Engrammata3 nor can it be
doubted that it comes from an original identical with the
Vetus codex known to Ernst, leaving off as it does with the
very same line. Whether, however, the writer of these
sixteen verses copied also the preceding 138—269, and this
originally complete fragment was known to Ernst, or
whether Ernst's copy was wholly independent of these
sixteen verseS‚ are questions which we cannot solve.
