THE DATE OF ‘AETNA'

earth contains, sea, lake, river, mountain, cavern, cascade,
prairie, volcano) which have descended to us from antiquity,
this poem is by far the most elaborate in details, by far the
most scientific, in its purpose and its reasoning. And,
whether it was in repute as a successful attempt on the lines
of* Lucretius, or under condemnation for its over—minuteness
and prosaic insistence on matters little congenial to a public
trained by Ovid, such as the character of the lava-stone,
and its appearance under different circumstances 5 in either
case, known as it must have been (on the hypothesis of
Augustan authorship) to a man so perfectly acquainted with

it over in absolute silence. Was it recognized as a success?
It might supply words for a new attempt. If it was thought
tiresome, Lucilius, remembering this, would be less anxious
about his own possible failure. If we may trust Seneca's
own infimation, Lucilius was enamoured of the subject, and
was longing to compose something fine that might rival his
predecessors, Vergil, Ovid, and Corn. Severus (salinam
mouet .· cupis grande aliquid et par prioribus scribere).

3. Let us now assume the counter-hypothesis‚ that Aetam
was not known to Seneca at the time he wrote Epist. 79.
Is there anything in the poem which makes Wernsdort‘s
ascription of it to Lucilius more than probable?

In answer to this, we may say that a close connexion
between Aetna and Seneca's works, particularly the [Vaturczl
Questions, is traceable‚ not indeed in the cast of the
language (for Seneca's style, like Emerson’s, is not easily
imstable, and the language of poetry is not the language
of prose), but in the speculations with which both of the
friends were concerned‚ the style of their reasoning, the
