AETN A

I find it difficult to believe that so careful a writer as our
poet should have admitted so startling an archaism‚ and incline
to make aureus agree with aether: then surgat=‘ dawn‚’ the
poet transferring to the sky the word which properly belongs to
morning. [Manil. i. 389, Sil. iii. 659 are not enough to support
surgat as active ¹.]

333 Illinc ab eo lom, i.e. the crater of Aetna. A similar
cloud is stated by the Schol. on Ap. Rhod. iii. 41 as seen
hovering over the flame-discharging crater of the volcanic island
Hiera.

ι 334 Pigra as ‘ only moving slowly isit move at all.’ Strabo 274
calls it νέφος ἠρεμοῦν, implying that it was or seemed usually to
be quiescent. defuso, ‘ rainy ' or ‘dripping,' so umida.

335 Prospectant sublimis opus uastusque receptus. C.

prospectans M unro uas . . . S, tlte rest of tlte v. torn away :
uastosque Relzd. receptus Rehd. v.

Munro’s prospectans is a clear gain, in every way superior to
Prospectat of the earlier editors including Haupt, who inverted
334, 335. Whether receptus should be kept, is not so clear.
MSS. agree in giving it, and Vergil's Planities zgrnota iacet
tutique receplnS, Aen. xi. 527, Statius’ placuit sedes fidique
receptus, Theb. vii. 443, have a certain resemblance. But in
both passages the epithets 'point to the meaning, a safe, trusty
retreat, i. e. as Serv. on Aen. xi. 527 quo se tuto exercitus
recz‘pz't3 whereas in the v. os Aetna it could only mean ‘with-
drawing places‚' i.e. where a fissure in the side of the mountain
recedes inwardly, presenting to the eye an enormous chasm.
Forc. and Georges cite no parallel3 yet as recipere se or
recipere neut. has the general sense of ἀναχωρεῖν, ‘to retire,' it
does not seem impossible that the plural receptus may have
been borrowed by our poet from Vergil, at the same time

¹ ln Silius’ Africus aut pontum surgens super aethera Caurus, the
Oxsord MS. has surgenS, but the two best MSS. L and F spargens,
which might suggest that spargat has been corrupted into surgat in
Aetn. 332. In Manil. i. 389 surgentem sidera is in the Gemblacensis
and all Bechert’s MSS. except M (Matritensis), which has S. ad
sidera.
