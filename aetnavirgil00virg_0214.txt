AETN A

ιἰιάίιι was rightly felt by &Vernsdorf and Mahly to be strange ;
both of them suggested quassa mealu (so too Haupt and
Baehrens); Unger conjectured boatu: I have proposed (suurn.
ofPlzz'lology for 1899, p. 111) effatu from Sall. Hist. fr. ii. 28
Maurenbrecher alione casu an, sapientibus ut placet, uenti per
caua terrae citatu rupti aliquot montes tumulique sedere.
Here Sallust seems to have used citatus very nearly as = conci-
tatio, a violent or impetuous motion, and this, (which is more
to the point), of wind rushing violently along the porosities of
the earth and bursting mountains open. If citam is right,
(quassa cz'talu for quassat hiatu), there must be a full pause
after caducam and the construction of 173, 174 will be ana-
coluthic‚ the poet meaning Inde, neque alind est huius rei
omen aeracius, uentura est mundo antiqui (mundi) facies, but
working the clause uentura est . ‚facies into dependence on
neque aliud est aeracius omen, intelligiblyy enough, but with some
loss of clearness.
If we retain quassat hiatu, there will be a pause at solo (soli)3

que will answer to neque.

Hinc uenti rabies, hinc saeuo quassat hiatu

Fundamenta soli: trepidant urbesque caducae

Inde, neque est aliud, si fas est credere, mundo

Venturam antiqui faciem ueracius omen.
On either view trepidant urbesque is not a case of que mis-
placed=lrepida72lque urbes. M unro on 79 has persuaded himself
of this in Aetna much oftener than an attentive consideration
of the parallels he cites can justify.

lt is perhaps not a mere accident that uenturum, not

uenturam, is the earlier reading of C. Gellius (i. 7) calls
attention to an archaic use of the participle -urum as an inde—
clinable future infinitive : ‘ uerbum est indefinitum, quod Graeci
appellant ἀπαρέμφατον, neque numeris neque generibus praeser-
uz'ens, set liberum undique et z'npromz'scum.’ He cites examples
from Plautus, C. Gracchus, Claudius Quadrigarius, Valerius
Antias, and one from Cic. Verr. Act. ii. Orat. 5. 167 quocumque
uenerint, hanc siln· rem pracsidio futurum. Gellius says sulm-um
(notszcluram) was written here in ‘libro spectatae fidei, Tiro-
niana cura atque disciplina sacto’3 and his statement may be
