COMMENTARY

agrees, bringing diuersas into more emphatic contrast. Ar.
Acharn. 493 ἅπασι μέλλεις εἶς λέγειν. Orient. Common. ii. 192
Et quae per uarias mors ruit una uias.

289 sortes sor forte of MSS. means that they increase their
volume and turn the head of Aetna, taking it in the rear (Mahly).
The nominative is, as usual, vague : Mahly is probably right in
making it nubes et nubilus Auster: and so Munro.

[Of the earlier emendations Baehrens'forte erexere is perhaps
the best] ’

290 una of MSS. looks wrong, since there is nothing to
which it can well refer: it cannot be a mistake sor ima
(accus. neut.) as Birt supposes. supplying an impossible nomina-
tive to premit in concordia of 287; nor for uda (Sudhaus), sc.
aura, which is vague and awkward‚ substituting an adjective
where a noun is expected. Buecheler retaining una supplies
anima or aura ‘nam unus uentus subito commissus ceteris et
colluctatus initium turbarum facit omnium.’ Against this it may
be urged that (1) una is still unduly vague, (2) the introduction
of the water—organ and the Triton trumpeting by hydraulic
action (292—297) points to a mention of water in some distinct
word in 290. Hence Ι follow Scaliger and Munro in writing
unda, the water from the clouds, which acts upon the air.

Lindenbruch defended delecta of MSS. from Asin. iii. 3. 42
ex aedibus delegit: add Cic. in Vatin. xiv. 34 urnas delegerit,
where other MSS. give deiecerit, Prop. ii. 32· 50 altaque mortali
deligere ostra manu, Tac. Ann. i. 22 responde ubi cadauer ablegerz's
(so the Medz'ceus). lt is not yet proved that legere in these
compounds may not have had a sense, distinct from its ordinary
one, of removing or detaching. Here, however, the water is
launched violently downwards (praecipiti sono), and sor this the
right word is DEIECTA z an elongated i or I is often indistinguish-
able from l or L. Sen. de Prov. ii. 1 tantum superne deiectorum
imbrium.

291 T orrentibus auris occurs Lucr. ν. 410 in the sense of
‘torrid airs' (Munro), and torrentes auras, if genuine, should
seem to have the same meaning (and so Sudh. ‘ die gliihenden
Liifte).' But is it likely, if this is so, that the poet would give
torrentibus in 298 the perfectly different sense of streaming
