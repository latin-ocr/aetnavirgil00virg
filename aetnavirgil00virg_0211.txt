COMMENTARY

‘ real restorations ’ of Aetna which we owe to G : to me it seems
to perplex and confuse everything.

Can we explain C? By the change of one letter, we can.
Substitute uacans sor uacat, and the whole is intelligible:
impetus omnis (est) illuc, quodcumque uacans hiat, ‘the whole
force (of the powers working in Aetna) is towards any point
which is open chasm,’ illuc (adverb)=ad id. For this change
we have the support of Vat. 3272 uocafit: for what is this but
a surviving trace of uocas=uosans, another form of uacans?
In this way the important and determining word impetus (Lucr.
v, 814 omnis Impetus) can be retained, and as the argument
is that, although the volcanic forces rush naturally for an open
vent, yet, when it is reached, their violence abates and loses its
fury‚ et in 163 would seem to be an error sor Set or less
probably At.

165 sqq.

Quippe ubi contineat uentosa quaquaeque morantis⁹ (sz'c)

165 contineat Reled. v: continuat S: qui teneat Gyr. uentos
aqua queque S: uentos aquasque Gyr. 166 desint Sv:
desinit ledat: defit Gyr. 167 errantis SRelzd. z erranteis
Gyr. limite Gyr. tradant Gyr. as reported by tlte sena
editor: tradunt G yr. as stated by ltlattllz'ae.

This is a passage where Gyr. is generally thought to be
nearer the true reading than CS, and must therefore be care-
fully scrutinized. From aquasque Munro's ‘always deep-pene-
trating acumen¹’ elicited acuatque, and this looks right,
accounting as it does for the a which is found in both C and S
(uentosa queque). Gyrsss qui teneat is also adopted by Munro,
‘ubi in uacuo defit qui (=quo) (uacuum) uentos teneat atque
ita acuat morantes': and Hildebrandt supports this by Cic.
Off. iii. 1. 1 ita duae res quae lauguorem adserunt ceteris, illum
acuebant. Sudhaus explains qui as nominative, and supposes
the poet to persam-'sy the influence which alternately restrains
and stimulates the winds. A nominative certainly seems more
