Sirius is properly the name of a particularly bright star in
the DOg. Arat. Phaen. 329 ἡ δέ οἱ ἄκρη Ἀστέρι βέβληται δεινὴ
γένυς, ὅς ῥα μάλιστα Ὀξέα σειριάει· καί μιν καλέουσ’ ἄνθρωποι
Σείριον (‘ In his fell jaw Flarnes a star above all others with
searing beams Fiercely burning, called by mortals Sirius‚’
E. Poste).

incubet, ‘ broods,’ in reference to the sultry beat of the dog-days
(XVernsdorf) like incumbere3 G. ii. 377 grauis incumbens scopulis
arentibus aestas: not so probably to watching narrowly, G. ii.
507, Aen. vi. 610, and the passages there cited by Conington.

index can hardly refer to one legend of Sirius, that ‘as the
dog of Icarius or Icarus he brought Erigone to her father's dead
body’ (Munro), sor that legend dissociates him from Orion,
with whom our poet obviously connects him. Sudhaus may be
right in explaining from Arat. Phaen. 755, 756 Ὠρίωνα . . . κύνα
τε θρασὺν Ὠρίωνος of the undaunted hound ever on the watch
for prey to be pursued (Arat. Phaen. 340, 341), and guiding
his master, the huntsman Orion, towards it. Sudhaus, how-
ever, adopts excubet from Gyr„ a word which applies more
exactly to a walch-dog, and· suggests a slightly altered idea,
viz. that Sirius keeps watch to give his master notice against
any of {he fierce animals which it was his function (in one
form of the legend, Hyg. l. c.) to exterminate. Schol. Germ.
Breysig, p. 75, states that Orion’s dog was traditionally omnibus
feris immilem.

[Jacob explained index of the signs which the Dog-star gives
of coming harvests‚ periods of siekness, war or peace, Man. i.
396 sqq.. and so Alzinger: ‘ o'er what region S. bends wistfully
to give premonitory sign.'

247. disiecta, Le Clerc ‘dispersed ’ (Lucr. ii. 939) for dzssgesta
of MSS. Ad Herenn. iv. 2. 3 laec ipsum summum est artificium
res uarias ct dispares in lot poematis et orationibus sparsas et
uage disiectas ita dilzgenler elzgrere ut unum quodque genus
exenqfilorum sub singulos artis locos subicere possis. But con-
gesta of Gyn, ‘ piled in a mass,' ‘ confused‚' may be right, for it
is no uncommon fact of MSS. to present the same verb with
