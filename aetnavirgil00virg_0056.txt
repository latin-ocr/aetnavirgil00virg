PROLEGOMENA

nowhere occurs in Aetna, does not entirely disprove my
hypothesis. The poet might have alluded elsewhere to
his heroine, not as Aetna, but as Perseis, and Ovid may
have borrowed this title from him. Or, if the poem was
not in high esteem with the literary world of the time,
Ovid might prefer to mention it by an ambiguous patro-
nymic, rather than by its more commonly known title.
We can imagine the wits of the later Augustan era
parodying Cicero's criticism (ad Q. Fr. ii. 11) of Sallustius’
Empedoclea: ‘uirum te putabimus si Trinacrii Aetnam
legeris, hominem non putabimus)
