COMMENTARY

κυρτωθέν) is the right epithet to aestu, and well accords with the
arched shape of the waves implied by cernulus or cernulat ; but
there is no idea of a hurricane or whirlwind in the passage3
nor can agit well be dragged from its place in another clause to
give a verb to cernulus turbo. If turbo was written by the poet,
which with Birt 1 think unlikely, the verb would more natu·
rally be increpat, ‘strikes a rushing sea'3 but what then is
aestu ?]

which tenuis (accus. plur.) would agree.

Munro extracted an intelligible sense by changing imas to
simas : he punctuated thus

Ac primum tenuis, simas agit ulteriores.
‘Its undae (492) are first tenues, then, as they go on, become
more and more simae, curling or turned up.'

Hardly enough, perhaps, has been said about the unusual
rhythm at the end of the verse ulteriores: yet this is the only
certain instance in Aetna of such a licence. Nor has it been
observed that the very same word occurs in the same place in
Germanicus’ Aratea 429 Breysig :

Huic primos tortus crater premit, ulterioris

Voeali rostro coruus forat. .
Yet the rule which the two poets followed in allowing this penta-
syllable to form the fifth and sixth feet os a hexameter may well
have been the same, namely, to make a pause after the fourth
foot, and to make this foot not only a dactyl, but a dactyl of
which the υ υ form a separate word (agit, premit).

On this hypothesis I write the verse of Aetna thus :

Ac primum tenuis simans agit, ulteriores
