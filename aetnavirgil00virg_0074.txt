PROLEGOMENA

siders that the Laurentian fragment was never more than
the sixteen verses which still survive.

It must here be stated that this Laurentian MS. 33. 9
contains, besides Aeta. 270—285, the minor poems of
Claudian (p. 287 sqq. in Birt’s edition), written in a hand
recognizably¹ the same which has added in a copy of the
Vicentine ed. princ. of Claudian, also in the Laurentian
Library (A. 4. 36), variants on most of the carmina maiora
drawn from a very old codex, thus described in a note on
the first book In Rufinum (v. 20) ζ lzz'uc coepi corgferre cum
uetustissimo codice mnia· cujusdam Lucensis ². geminis plm-
ctis . . notaturus quae illinc emendabo) The second book of
the In Rufinum and the other major poenis of Claudian
have also variants, which seem to be in the same writing‚
but the source of these is called ‘cod. B,⁷ leaving it
doubtful whether the codex of Lucca is identical (as Birt
thinks) with ‘ cod. B' or different. However this may be,
Heinsius knew these variants and set great store by them :
in his edition of Claudian, they are constantly quoted as
Lucam or drawn from a cod. Lucensis. He believed them
to come from a MS. earlier than the oldest, this earlier MS.
to have been identical with the codex used by Gyraldus for
copying Aetna. Hence he expended no little effort on the
attempt to re-discover it at Lucca, not with more success‘l²
despite his intimate relations with the most exalted patron⁴

¹ Birt, p. lxxxiv, By the kindness of Father Ehrle, S.J.‚ Librarian
of the Vatican, I possess an exact transcript of these 16 vv., which will
bc found on p. 134. They are written on the first os twelve paper
leaves (sol. 102-113v os the entire MS.) in double columns, and of
the fisteenth century.

² This is the origin of the name Lucensis for the supposed eighth
century MS. osClaudian.
