COMMENTARY

41, 42 (ed. Petschenig ¹) Qua defensa suo superata est Hectore
Troia, Vnum non poterat fraus superare senem ,5’ in which
defi’nsa suo Hectore Troia corresponds to our poet’s extinctos
suo Phrygas Hectore, ‘the Phrygians quenched by their own
Hector‚’ sc. by his extinction ². The harshness of the abl. is
diminished by its resemblance to constructions like iacent suis
testibus, Mil. xviii. 473 geminus iacet lzoste superbo Scipio,
Sil. xv· 3.

590. ducis. ⁴ Hector, the burning of whose body, placing his
bones wrapt in purple robes in a golden chest‚ laying this
in a trench and strewing large stones over it, form the last
scene of the Iliad, xxiv. 788—804. Aen. v. 371 ad tumulum quo
maximus occubat Hector. Strabo 595 mentions an ἅλσοςἜκτορος
near Rhoeteum, but says nothing of any tomb. On another
account, Hector's bones were buried at Ophrynion in the Troad
(Peplos 59, see Radtke in Hermes xxxvi. 40).

Achilles' tomb and temple were shown at Sigeum, Strab. 596,
as well as the tombs of Patroclus and Antilochus.

prophecy, ΙΙ. xxii. 359, killed Achilles, the slayer of his brother,

says πρὶν ’γὰρ πόλις ἥδε κατ’ ἄκρης Πέρσεται· ἧ ’γὰρ ὄλωλας ἐπίσκοπος,

by Seneca de Const. Sapientis ii. 3 speaking of Cato, abstractus
comitem se diu sustentatae ruinae dedxt, simulque exstincta sunt, quae

nefas erat diuidi: neque enim Cato post libertatem uixit nec libertas
