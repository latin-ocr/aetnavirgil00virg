AETNA

supposed to have written, tacitus tremit. Sudhaus can hardly
be right in punctuating aster occulto, and making Aetna the
subject of tremit: if tremit is right, not only rhythm, but
the general feeling of the passage, is in favour of Iuppiter as
nominative. This is recognized by Damste'‚ who conjectured
in occ. tantumfremit, i.e. murmurs in secret alone, not venturing
to vent his indignation openly.

omniaque extra os Gyr. seems unlikely to be the original of
onmia dextra : rather, the d points to ad (at). Such a transitional
particle seems required ; que is very meaningless.

207 Quae is accusative aster fizciunt, not nominative, as
Munro explains: ueniunt of Gyr. is a palpable interpolation.
ulli of all MSS. Buecheler would retain as a genitive. Neue-
W'agener, Formenlehre, ii. p. 519 quote one instance, Truc.
ii. 2. 38 coloris ulli. Buecheler similarly would retain in 208
robustis of MSS„ robustis uiribus, as in Lucr. iii. 449, cf.
robusteis u. Carm. Epigr. 979 Buech. The ordering of the
words on this view Corporis ullz' robustis utribus seems to
me more prosaic, less Vergilian than our poet generally admits:
hence I follow Wernsdorf, Jacob, and Munro in writing ullis
and robusti.

208 Sustentata must mean ‘held back, kept in their place'
(Munro); nec qualifies sustentata only, not cadunt, as in Flor. iv.
12 noua quippe pax, necdum assuetae frenis seruitutis tumidae
gentium inflataeque ceruices ab imposito nuper iugo resiliebant,
i.e. et nondum assuetae resiliebant, ‘all this they do by no natural
tendency of their own, and are not supported in their places by
any strength of structure, and therefore fall’: i. e. are ejected
from the crater and so sall, eadunt implying the previous
ejection. In omnes Exagitant uenti turbas, the poet expounds
his assertion that volcanic effects are not due to the materials
themselves (nec sponte sua sacz'unt); the motive force is the
rush of winds inside the mountain. omnes accusative agreeing
with turbas, ‘all their powers of turmoil': Exagitant of Gyr.
is not certain for Exzjgruur of C. Exacuunt, or Excutt'unt
‘ discharge,' are also possible.

210 coniecta of C can hardly be right ; it is difficult to choose
between conlecta or congesta.
