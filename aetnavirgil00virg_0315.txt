COMMENTARY

540 signataque saxo Nomina conplexae, lacrimas in nomina
fundunt3 Her. xiii. 66 Signatum memori pectore nomen habe.

532 Can notas be retained? 1f I were bent on following
the MSS. alone, I should pause before accepting nolae, ‘of
fusible character‚' sor though this is much neater, nolas is
explicable: the Sicilians in the word by which they describe
certain actual kinds of stone imply that they have marks
of fusibility. fusilis would thus be genitive of a neuter
fusile.

533 foueat is not ‘cherish the fire‚’ for no such accus. can
be got from the passage. The only possible accus. is the
stones therriselves (532 numquam tamen illa (saxa) liquescunt),
which possess a more fluid substance within to keep sltem
warni or maintain them in a state capable of being fomented
into flame (cf. fomes), just as he speaks before of fire glow-
ing in pingui suco (395). Relad. however has an interesting
v. 1. succentior3 whence 1 conj. succensior, a comparative
of the participia] adj. succensus, like instructior, apertior,
acceptior, ἃς.

534 Sense and logie require the change of Nec to Nei or Ni,
‘ unless.’ Munro alone retains Nec, translating, ‘ Nor will those
stones have been properly matched against the structure of
the molaris in their inner substance,' which extracts from the
words more than they should naturally mean. Commissa, Sen-
ad Marc. 23 ignis uiuacior est, qui cum lenta ac difficili materia
commissus fumoque demersus ex sordido lucet.

535-566 Let no one be surprised that the lava-stone is
susible. Heraclitus tells us that fire is the seed of all things,
and that everything gives way to fire. We see that it is so
in our own experiments with the hardest metals, bronze, lead,
iron, gold. True, the lava-stone does not succumb readily,
with a small fire, or in open daylight3 you must have a
close furnace, and a fire of more than average strength3
then it will fuse. And where can you find a furnace like
Aetna; nurse of secret fire, only comparable with the fires
launched by Jupiter ; this too seconded by a tense spirit which
is forced out of the narrow pores of the mountain?
