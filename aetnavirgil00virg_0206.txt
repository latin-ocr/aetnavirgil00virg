had Antraque demersas penitus fodisse latebras. There is
nothing unusual in making the lairs (cubilia) and caverns
(antra) scoop out themselves (fodisse) the hollows into which
the forces of nature have shaped the ground. Heinsius
indeed accepted this <with spatiosa for spatioque) as right:
So too Jacob and Munro, and lately Hildebrandt and Sudhaus.
Yet spatioque of MSS. is not per se improbable, que answering
to maraque, ‘both lairs and caves‚' and retro (restro v)
representing an adjective or participle in the ablative3 or
again spatioque may have been originally spatiante ‘ex-
patiating,’ ranging to and fro in different directions, ef.
Trist. V. 3. 23 lato spatiansem flumine Gangen, Plin. H. N.
xvii. 4 5 inlus ut in metallis spczsz'anle uena: retro or restro
would represent some ablative‚ possibly rostro, the hound’s
scent (here expressed by ‘muzzle') guiding him in its wide-
sweeping range to the lair (cubile) of the hunted beast. Such
lairs would often be found to be hollows in the soil, of more
or less depth and extension. Luc. iv. 91 nec creditur ulli Silua
cani, nisi qm· presso uestzssgffa rostro Colligit et praeda nescit
latrare reperta. .

A further doubt attaches to demersas of Gyr. sor which
all existing MSS. give demissas. Vergil’s alteque iubebis In
solido puteum demz'llz’ (G. ii. 230) is very parallel.

Coming to 142, we are not much helped by Gyr.‘s aeri lanlum
efftgz‘t ultra for operum tansum ffuit im‘ra of our existing
MSS. For (1) ‘operum seems necessary’ (Munm), who trans·
lates ‘you cannot trace out these constructions'3 (2) effluit
would be right of air slreczmz'ng met, as Lucr. i. 280 (Alzinger) ;
(3) intra, inside the cavern‚ as is perceptible to any one entering
it; (4) the nominative has fallen out and was contained in a verse
lost before CS were copied. Now consider Gyr. (1) aeri, not
(zer, is recorded by the Jena editor and Matthiae ; (2) Sudhaus
explains Gyr. thus: in these deep chasms the path loses itself
beyond all tracing: air alone makes its way beyond: adding
ἑιιίίκιι sc. quam homines uel progrediamur uel prospectent!
This is against the ordinary use of incompertus, ‘unascertained ‘
of mcllzaa's or processes, not ‘ undiscovered ’ of things or natural
objects: it rather forces ultra: generally it is a somewhat
