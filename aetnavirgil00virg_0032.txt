PROLEGOMENA

of the last dactyl elided before a bacchius, libera auena,
impia agellos, flumina amica, aduena arator, cm'mina agelli,
Battare auena, gaudia habetis, ludere in herba ¹.

Nake, in his edition of the Dirae and Lydia, has noted
as characteristic features of the older poetry before the
rise of Vergil, two points which may be mentioned here:
(1) repetition of the same word or the same types of ex-
pression at short intervals 3 (2) the connective use of qui,
e. g. Cul. 143 Quis aderat ueteris myrtus non nescia fati,
168 egfert Sublimi ceruice caput: cui crista superne Edita
purpureo lucens maculatur amictu. Of these the second
is only found twice in Aetna (400, 436): the first, though,
from the poet’s tendency to return again and again to the
description of the same phenomena or the enforcement of
the same reasonings, there is some unavoidable recurrence
of similar or even identical words, cannot be said to obtrude
itself in any marked degree.

But it is not only the absence of early simplicities; it is
far more the uniform presence of an artificial mannered and
rhetorical form which makes the pre-Vergilian date of Aetna
impossible. One example will suffice, vv. 8 5-93 :—

Nec tu, terra, satis: speculantur numina diuum

Nec metuunt oculos alieno admittere caelo.

Norunt bella deum, norunt abscondita nobis

Coniugia, et falsa quotiens sub imagine peccet

Taurus in Europen, in Laedam candidus ales,

luppiter, ut Danaae pretiosus fluxerit imber:

Debita carminibus libertas ista, sed omnis

In uero mihi cura; canam quo feruida motu

Aestuet Aetna, nouosque rapax sibi congerat ignes.

¹ I say nothing of Varro Atacinus, the fragments of whose poems,

though a much closer approximation to the style and rhythm of
Vergil, are too scanty to admit of a satisfactory estimate, and them-
selves of very uncertain date.
