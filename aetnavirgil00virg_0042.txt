PROLEGOMENA

wrote poenis, and on Sicilian subjects. N. Q. iii. 1. 1
a verse of his is quoted——

Elisus Siculis de fontibus exsilit amnis.

N. Q. iii. 26 Seneca refers to a poem by Lucilius on
Arethusa 3 N. Q. iv. 2 he calls him ‘ my poet' (quare non
cum poeta meo iocor et illi Ouz'dz'mn suzam inpingo ἲ), and
three other lines of his are cited in the Epistles. Of these
we should have known nothing but for their accidental
preservation by Seneca. It is therefore no improbable
hypothesis that a similar oblivion may have fallen on him
as writer of our poem Aetna.

2. This may be stated in another way. If an elaborate
Latin poem of more than 609 lines, sufficiently finished
to be ascribed at some period before Donatus (i. e. Sue-
tonius) to Vergil, was in circulation in the later years of
Augustus, and known to Seneca (750-—818=4 B.C.——65 A.D.)
either as a young man or in middle age, i.e. in the reigns
of Tiberius (14—37)‚ Caligula (37-41), Claudius (41—511), is
it likely that he would wholly have ignored it when writing
to Lucilius on this very subject in the reign of Nero? This
argument becomes stronger when we remember that Seneca,
in the passage quoted above from Epist. 79, is speaking
of poetical, not prose, descriptions of the volcano, Lucilius
is to ascend Aetna and observe with his own eyes what
he is then to describe in his promised poem. But if our
Aetna was already familiarly known, or if it was known
at all, how could it escape either Seneca or Lucilius, both
of them poets, both, which is more to our purpose, keen
explorcrs of natural phenomena? For of all the rare
descriptions, not merely of Aetna, but of any similar object
of nature (including under this term everything which our
