Sudhaus:

Scintillae procul ecce fides, procul ecce ruentis (or, ruentes).
‘ The sparks‚ see there in the distance, are proof thereos (of
the lava still retaining its heat), see there in the distance, the
falling sparks, for they do not lose their glow,' thus agreeing
with Munro that fides= the proof, voucher. cf. 515 Et figulos

In 1887 I wrote as follows :

The poet ⁶ here contrasts the impetuous onset of the lava-
flood, which was sufficiently strong to carry it over the bed of
the river Symaethus, with the utter immobility of the same lava-
stream when hardened and solidified afterwards. Hence ut is
“ though'': illas are the banks which no effort of human skill
can, afterwards, part clear again from the immovable lava-mass
which now crosses thern. But iunctis, though retained by
Munro, is so extraordinarily harsh that Ι think it must be
wrong, and Ι would read for it uncis, grappling-irons or grips
which might naturally be used for hauling up heavy weights, or
getting stronger hold upon them.'

iunctis, if right, must be zjgnffius, illas, sc. ripas: in this
Munro, Buecheler, Sudhaus are agreed.

Munro, however (1867), held a different view of ut. ‘ But
when its force has carried the stream of fire over the banks of
Symaethus, scarce any one, Ι warrant (fizxo), will sever them
from the fiery mass that has joined them.'

He therefore explained ut ‘when'3 if so, quondam must be
‘ at some time.’

Sudhaus explains ut quondam ‘if only some day’: iunctis,
