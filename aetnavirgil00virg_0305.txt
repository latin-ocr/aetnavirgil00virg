COMMENTARY

ποιῆσον ἀντιτυπίαν τινὰ καὶ κλάσιν ἐμβριθὲς εἶναι καὶ πυκνόν, ἵνα πρὸς
αὐτὸ πληγὴ καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ φορὰ γένηται. More naturally ‘ blows
conveyed by its striking’=which it conveys in striking3 in
this case the process of striking and the actual blow are thought
of separately.

503—504 Emicat examen plagis ardentia saxa

Scintillas procul esse fides procul esse ruentis
Incolumi feruore cadunt. C.

No verse has raised more discussion than 504; scintillas, esse,
fides have each been treated as wrong3 whence many diverse
emendations. Scaliger changed scintillas to scintillant (which
would imply an early confusion of -at with -as), este fides to ecce
fide3 then procul fide would be like procul dubio: and ruentis
(ruentes) nom. to cadunt. Le Clerc followed Scal„ except that
he wrote uide for fide: and so NVernsdorf.

D’Orville also accepted Scintillam, but wrote the rest of the
verse procul este sudes, procul este tridentes, with the improbable
meaning, that stakes and levers might as well retire‚ as they
would be of no avail in getting rid of the lava.

In this conj. of D’Orville’s, however, there is much to be said
for este, a sudden apostrophe to curious observers to get out of
the way ε Ι have followed him so far, with the change offides to
pedes, ‘away‚ ye feet, away with all your speed.’ Cf. Plautus’
propera, pedes hortare, Stich. ii. 2. 8. Sil. xvii. 28 procul hinc,
moneo, procul llinc, quaecumque profanae, Ferte gradus. Sen.
de Constant. Sapient. xix. 1 procul auferendi pedes sunt. The
connexion of this with Incolumi feruore cadunt is thus very clear,
‘away with all speed, for the burning masses lose none of their
glowing heat in falling!

[Haupt wrote the passage

ardentia saxa
Scintillae procul ecce uides procul ecce ruentis
Incolumi feruore cadunt.
Munro follows C without alteration,

Scintillas procul esse fides, procul esse ruentis.
‘The constr. is saxa, scintillas procul esse fides est plagis: the
fact that burning stones, that sparks are far away, far away as
they fall to the ground, is a proof that this is caused by blows.’
