COMMENTARY

what remained was corrected into gigni. Thus the two
statements which appear sels-contradictory, (1) that fire can
destroy everything, (2) that it is the creator of everything, are
brought into marked antithesis by nihil, omma, each standing
at the beginning of its clause. 1t is more than probable that
the Greek dicta referred to began (1) with οὐδέν, (2) with πάντα.

[Sudh. keeps gigni with que e sor quae and a question aster
mirum. Nothing born can stand against the etemal law of
change, everything that springs from the womb of nature is
seed laid for some future existence. But if Heraclitus was well
known to represent fire as the element underlying all things, if
Lucr. goes out of his way expressly to refute him (i. 635 sqq.)
on tlzis very point, it seems incredible that our poet should
introduce a reference to him, when he is arguing about fire, and
yet never mention the word at all.]

537 nihil insuperabile ab igni. This might follow from the
Heraclitean dictum (fr. lxx Byw.) ξυνὸν ἀρχὴ καὶ πέρας. If fire is
the beginning of things, it may also be the end. Again (fr. lxxvii),
‘ Man is a fire that kindles and is quenched‚’ in which the same
idea may be traced.

538 The language of Lucr. is very illustrative: i. 690 Dicere
porro ignem res omnes esse neque ullam Rem ueram in numero
rerum constare nisi ignem. Heraclitus maintained that fire was
everything, and was the one true principle of things. Munro
cites his famous dictum πυρὸς ἀνταμείβεται (ἀνταμοιβὴ τὰ Diels)
πάντα καὶ πῦρ ἁπάντων, ὥσπερ (ὅκωσπερ D.) χρυσοῦ χρήματα καὶ
χρημάτων χρυσός (fr. xxii in Bywater’s Heracliti Reliquiae) : so
also fr. xx Bywater (ὁ κόσμος) ἦν alei καὶ ἔστι καὶ ἔσται πῦρ ἀείζωον,
