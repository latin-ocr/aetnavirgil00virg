P ROLEGOMENA

Aetna has two states, one of violence and fury, the other of
silent preparation within, when an eruption is still fax· off.

(357—399) Whatever may be the cause that gives such potency
to the air in the volcano, the phenomena of eruption are the
same, fiery masses of rock, showers of black sand, stones
shivering as they encounter each other, detonating flashes.
lt is not true that after such an explosion, time must elapse
before another can ensue; such attenuation of force is no part
of the divine ordering of nature. lt is owing to some obstruction
in the channels through which the spirit passes that such lulls
happen: a mass of rock gets in the way and prevents the air
from within escaping, or the winds from without penetrating
to the interior. But such stoppage and the delay it occasions
are followed by an outburst of proportionally increased violence;
the fire bursts out with desolating fury and spreads in a lava-
flood over all the adjoining country. Then is the time for all
the inflammable substances in Aetna to take fire and burn,
sulphur, alum, bitumen, &c The presence of these substances
is shown partly by springs of water at the foot of Aetna, which
have a sulphurous or bituminous taste, partly in the form of
stones which liquefy, notably the lapis molaris (lava-stone).

‹400-4'22) The external look of the molaris would not lead
you to think it could burn, but if struck with a mallet (or, iron bar i,
it gives out sparks, and if subjected to the action of a strong
furnace-fire, it fuses quicker than iron. Its special property
is to conserve fire, once kindled, with extraordinary tenacity,
unlike other substances, which when burnt out, cannot be
kindled again. These two facts of the molaris, (1) its forming·
the chief component of Aetna, (2) its tenacious hold on fire,
when once set burning, are the chief causes of the volcanic
conflagration.

(423*446) This may be tested as follows. Examine other
places where volcanic phenomena exist ; if they have no molaris,
the presence of other inflammable substances is not enough to
keep them in operation. Aenaria (lschia), once active, is now
extinct; the ground between Neapolis and Cumae (Solfcztara),
once volcanic, has long been cold, in spite of its copious supply
of sulphur, in which it far exceeds Aetna. The island Strongyle
