degrees advanced‚ on reaching level ground, to a distance of
twelve Roman miles. pronis is poetically better, suggesting one
cause of the progress of the lava-flood, namely the sloping
nature of the descent which it has to traverse before reaching
the level.

486 curtis of C, cartis of Rehd. A rund. is probably certis
(Wernsdorf). The steady resolute advance of the lava-stream
is one of its most alarming symptoms,

[Munro preferred curuis, Birt tortis. Sudh. retains curtis,
‘trummerfiihrenden Feuerstrom' or ‘trummerartige Feuermas-
sen.’ I do not quite understand this, and Birt thinks it im-
possible. If curtis was written by the poet, it ought to mean
‘short‚' ‘ abridged,’ i.e. dwarfed and not of the fully-developed
size and altitude which lava-billows sometimes assume. Such
an abridged height might, Ι suppose, mark the lava-waves on
an unobstructed level, where there is no slope to give them
extra dip ancl no obstacle confronts them to cause the clz‘mbz‘ng,
which modern explorers so often mention as occurring at
intervals in the lava-stream’s progress ¹.

487 ‘No massy obstacle bars the way ineffectually,' frustra,
because when any such barrier does present itself‚ the lava
overpowers it, climbing, sor instance, high walls. The con-
struction is somewhat akin to Cat. lxiv. 103 Non ingrata tamen
frustra munuscula diuis Promz'llens.

simul omnia pugnant, not ‘ everything is fighting on the same
side‚' but ‘everything is in conflict at the same time.’ The
stream takes into itself a variety of objects‚ carrying them along
with it: rocks= stoneS, trees, boughs, large masses of earth, ἀς.
These clash and collide with each other. Similarly, Ovid M. v.
150 coniurata undique pugnant Agmina.

Nunc siluae rupesque notant haec tela solumque
Ipsa adiutat opes facilesque sibi induit amnis. C.
Of the emendations offered sor notant, two are more likely

¹ The passage would then mean ‘the fires are of under-size and
encounter no obstacle‚' which would increase their bulk and add to

their volume.
