AETNA

with that great supply in Aetna’: then illi will be uberi, or
perhaps incendio from 439 3 so Haupt, but with igni for illi.

Munro preferred Sed non Aetnaeis uires quae conferat illis,
which 1 have found in the Paris ed. of 1507. This seems to me
less probable, as the poet avoids rhyming -is with —z's.

[Scaliger, Le Clerc, and Wernsdorf, accepting illi as genuine,
prefer to change quae to quas, and aethnei to Aetnaeis, i. e. sed
non illi sunt uires quas conserat Aetnaeis.

[Sudhaus makes conserat = ‘bestOW, impart,’ retaining
Aetnaei, sed non quae conserat uires Aetnaei (uberis) illi (insulae
or terrae).]

443 llaec ipsa, this smaller part that is still active volcano.

444 adgereret, a good word, retaining its hold on classical
Latin from Plautus to Cicero, thence from Vergil to Pliny,
Vitruvius, and Tacitus. C has adgeneret.

445 siluam is here explained by Materiam, as i. q. ὕληντ no
proof can be drawn from this that the plur. siluae in 384 has
such a meaning. suam, ‘its own ’ 3 left alone Hiera would have
been extinguished long before the poet's time3 but a channel
under the sea connected it with Aetna, which lent its own
materials for conflagration.

canali. Diodor. V. 7 λέγουσι γάρ τινες ἐκ τούτων τῶν νήσων
ὑπονόμους εἶναι κατὰ γῆς μέχρι τῆς Αἴτνης καὶ τοῖς ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα στο-
μίοις συνημμένους· διὸ καὶ κατὰ τὸ πλεῖστον ἐναλλὰξ κάεσθαι τοὺς ἐν
ταύταις ταῖς νήσοις κρατῆρας τῶν κατὰ τὴν Αἴτνην. Daubeny p. 264,
‘The Lipari islands are so placed with reference to Naples and
Sicily, that they seem to form a link between the two countries,
whence some have inferred that a subterranean communication
passes through thern, extending from Etna to Vesuvius': but
he declines to pronounce on the point.

446 posceret of C is explained by Hildebrandt, Heia-agre, p. 23
note, as ⁴ called out,’ ‘called for the fire to appear ’ ε Luc. i. 29
desuntque manus poscentibus aruis. With this the nomina-
tive Siculi uicinia mantis does not well agree: with all other
editors I prefer pasceret.

447-448 are thus written in C:

ta
Sed melius res ipsa notis spectaque uentis

Occurrit signis nec tegiptat fallere pestem.
