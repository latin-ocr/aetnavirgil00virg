AETNA

every quanter, which then form a league and gain
new strength by union3 or whether again they
are driven inwards by clouds and the south wind
that brings clouds, or waxing bold have rounded
the head of Aetna and sweep on behind 3 then the
water hurrying noisily downwards presses upon the
torpid airs and drives thern off, and by its blows
condenses the particles that compose thern. For
just as an hydraulic vessel gives a sound by
Setting in motion a musical Triton: first the
machinery is pushed by the body of water collected
and the air which cannot resist the force that moves
it, next the trumpet bellows forth its long-drawn
tones 3 or as in some spacious theatre an hydraulic
organ with the diverse modes of its unequal tubes
sounds its watery music, by help of the controller‚Å∑s
skiss, which sets in motion a thin stream of air and
makes a rowing movement in the water below: just
so it is that the wind dislodged by the streaming
fluids and angered thereby, struggles in its straitened
room, producing a loud roaring from Aetna.

Again we must suppose that there are causes of wind
springing up underground like those we see outside:
that so, each tirne the particles press closely and
jostle each other, they may be squeezed out and
make for a free open space to avoid crowding,
and so rive by their heaving force and drag with
thern what is nearest, and only stop when they have
found a safe place to rest in.
