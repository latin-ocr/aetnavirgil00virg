EXCURsus ΟΝ v. 515.

Εἰ figulos lmz'c esse fidem.

Among the various hypotheses which have been framed to
account for the ascriptz'on of Aetna to Vergil, Ι do not remember
to have observed the occurrence in it of this allusion to the
potter's art. Vergil's father, according to Suetonius, Vit. 1
parentibus nmdicz‘sfm't ac praecipue patre, quem quidem opificem
fignlmn, plures Magi cuiusdam Μαίονές initio mercennarz'mn
. . . tradiderunt, and Phocas in the hexameters preserved in
MS. Paris 8093 (Riese, Anth. Lat. 671) 30-34:

Huic genitor figulus, Maro nomine, cultor agelli,

Vt referunt alii, tenui mercede locatus,

Sed plures figulum. quis non miracula rerum

Haec stupeat? diues partus de paupere uena

Enituit‚ figuli suboles noua carmina finxit,
was himself a potter. lt would require but little imagination in
any one acquainted with the two facts, the reputed occupatiori
of Vergil's father, and the appeal made in Aelrm to a minute
point connected with that occupation, to combine them in some
such reasoning as the following. The writer of Aetna shows an
exact knowledge of the facts of pottery: Vergil's father was
a potter: therefore Vergil was the writer of Aetna.
