Except the correction of 186, which is easy and cannot well be

(1) Allow that Corrigit might easily be an error for Porrlgit, as
Heinsius has shown (cf. Sen. ad Helv. ix. 2 where porrexerint is
spelt correxerint in Gertz' early and excellent codex A), and

itself by the mere force of antithetic clauses, Corrzgit penitus,
