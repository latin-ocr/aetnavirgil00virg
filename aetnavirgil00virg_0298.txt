AETNA

(1) 474—476, as it burns in single specimens, (2) in a heap,
(3) in a stream.

474 siquis lapidum. He imagines his reader coming upon
a piece of rock lying by itself, and burning at its surface, if this
is the meaning of summo igni: it cannot = maximo (Munro),
and would be a contradiction in language if it meant ‘ reaching
from the centre to the top,’ i. q. penitissimo: see on summis
causis, 158. The only other sense possible is, ‘the fire at the
top of the volcano,' i.e. in the crater: but how could such
a fact be ascertained ?

475 is thus written in C:

Asperior sopitaes et quaedam sordida faex est.

sopita est Relzd. Arund. : scobis iis P. Pithon: scabres Scala
species Munro: solito est Damste‘: sopita Le Clerc: tophis
Franke. Τ lze word is still unemended. sopito tlte present
editor sourn. ofPlzilol. 1892, p. 235, and so before me Maelzly.

The only palaeographical clue yet offered for sopitaes is
Munro’s suggestion that —aes represents a nom. sem. in —es;
this is a frequent phenomenon in MSS.; but the actual word
which Munro suggested, species, cannot be thought likely. In
Postgate's Corpus I have printed Maehly's conj. sopito, which
is possible Latin and makes fair sense: it would be dative,
sc. igni, when the fire is quenched its residuum is a dirty kind
of slag.

[Can sopilaes be a corruption of saeptis or saepteis? see
on 409]

476 cernes C with the other MSS. ‘You will see’ if you
make the experiment, 195.

477 exiluit sublata = exiluit et se sustulit. caducis saxis,
another of the datives our poet affects.

angusto uertice surgunt is considered by Sudh. and Hild.
parenthetical‚ the apocl. to ubi in 477 thus beginning at 479
Sic ueluti in fornace. This seems to me doubtful, though it
gives¹ a good meaning, since the gradual up-tapering of the
