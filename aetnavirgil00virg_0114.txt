(O shameful deed) to thrust down from the sky the
stars, and making Jupiter a captive, to transfer his
sovereignty to another, and lay under their laws the
conquer’d heaven. These have their proper (man's)
nature down to the belly: a scaly serpent wreathes
in circling coils their feet below. Huge mountains
build up a mound for waging battle: Ossa presses
Pelion down, Olympus’ top lies heavy on Ossa.
Already they are struggling to climb the mountain-
masses they have piled together, a godless soldiery is
challenging to close fight the affrighted constellations 5
in hostile array is challenging to battle the gods one

of the Cowering stars. Jupiter quails from his place
in heaven, and arming his glittering right hand with
flame withdraws the sky in gloom. The Giants begin
the charge with a mighty shouting: then the Father
of Gods thunders with a deep tone, and the winds
