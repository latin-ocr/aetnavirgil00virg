PROLEGOMENA

larger and more crested. By degrees the burning liquid stiffens
and cools‚ losing its appearance of a waving field of flame; as
the several masses congeal, they discharge a sume, and are
borne onward by their own momentum with a great crashing
noise3 brought into conflict with something solid, they open
and are seen to be white-hot in their core. Such collisions
are attended by showers of sparks, which you will be wise not
to come near ; but however far the lava—flood may be carried by
its own impetus, crossing‚ for instance, the river Simaethus and
joining· its banks‚ once cold and stiffi it is almost immovable.

(509—534) Beware of clinging to the delusive belief that the
molaris is not uniforin in substance, but liquefies in virtue of one
of its constituent portions, hardens in obedience to another, just
as when potters’ clay is submitted to the action of a furnace, it
has an inner substance which fuses, distinct from the remainder.
It would be truer to compare the molaris with copper under
smelting3 whether smelted or not, you recognize the copper;
so the nudaris, whether in its liquefied state or not, conserves
its characteristics unaltered. Its black colour is alone enough
to prove how truly it is always one and the same. But I would
not deny that particular kinds of stone, besides the molat-ss,
have the property of burning fiercely: nor that there is a
Sicilian word for rocks which implies their fusibility.

(535—566) Do not be surprised that the molaris is fusible.
Heraclitus tells us that fire is the seed of all things, and that
everything gives way to tire. We see that it is so in our own
experiments with the hardest metals, copper, lead, iron, gold.
True, the molarss does not succumb readily, with a small fire,
oi· in open day-light. You must have a close sumace, a fire of
more than average strength; then it will fuse. And where can
you find a furnace like Aetna, nurse of secret flames, only com-
parable with the thunder-bolts launched by Jupiter? This, too,
seconded by a tense sfil'rz'l which is forced out of theqnarrow
passages of the mountain, much as wind is forced out of bellows
by a continuous series of puffs.

(567—601) Men travel over land and sea to visit famous
shrines, cities of heroic or historic memories, pictures of world-
wide renown: Thebes, with hei· walls that rosc to the music of
