Its substance thus lost, it is sifted off a light imponder-
able pumice: meanwhile that lava-liquid assumes
a hotter glow and begins, after a long pause, to
advance more in the likeness of a gently-fiowing
stream, pouring its waves down the slopes of the hills.
The waves move gradually on and on for six miles

of the flames, nothing massy that bars the way with-

Here forests and cliffs, elsewhere the earth and
surface soil are afloat: the lava—stream itself rein-
forces their supply, and takes them into its current
readily conforming thereto. If it happens to halt and
is arrested in some valley’s depth, it grazes at large,
as you might guess, along the unevennesses of the
fields where it rolls its way: then the lava-billows
come crowding up, and the flood sounds noisily with
up-standing waves (even as when some rushing sea
dips forward with a cresting tide), and at first drives
them before it of small size and in fiat curves 3 such

lava-streams halt with their banks¹ arrested‚ and the
cold stiffens them into hardness: then by degrees
the fires close up, and lose the appearance of a
wax-ing field of flame. As each mass successively
