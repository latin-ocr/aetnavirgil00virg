AETNA

the realm of nature, this (fire) is the wondrous
nursery3’ bodies of closest texture and nearly solid
we notwithstanding often reduce by fire. See you
not how copper with all its stubbornness gives way
to flame? Does not fire strip away the toughness of
lead? Even iron's substance, for all its exceeding
hardness, is undermined by fire3 solid nuggets of
gold sweat out their precious ore in the pendent
smelting-kilns; and it may well be that the depths
of earth have lying in them some undiscovered
substances subject to the same allotment of nature.
This is no place for ingenuity: judge for yourself
and you will allow that the eyes are convincing. You
see how rigid is the lava-stone, how it is barred up
in front and resists all approach of fire, if you try
to burn it with only small fires and in the open
sky: well now, confine this same stone in a close
white-hot kiln, it cannot hold out or maintain itself
against that fierce enemy: it is defeated, its strength
dissolves, it yields to its captor, and melts. Yet what
engines, think, you, more effectual can art apply by
hand of man, or again, what fires can it sustain by
human means to rival the kilns with which Aetna is
heated? Aetna, that is at all times a prolific nurse
of mysterious fire, yet not such as glows with attemper'd
heat as used by us, but nearer the fire of heaven,
or like the flame that arms Jupiter himself. With
these strong forces is combined a powerfu] blast of air
forced out of the compressed orifices of the mountain3
even as when mechanics exert themselves to match
their strength against unwrought masses of iron, they

stir the smelting-fircS‚ drivc out the air in the panting
