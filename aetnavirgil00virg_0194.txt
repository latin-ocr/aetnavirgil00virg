.’ AETNA .

strauere has little to recommend it: septenst, which is found
in some fifteenth century MSS. and in the Paris ed. of 1507²
is without authority. It is probable from Prop. iii. 5. 44 et Tityo
iugera pauca nouem that it was a nice question with the pedants
of the time what was the space of ground in the lower world that
Tityus’ limbs covered. Cf. Sen. de breuit. uitae xiii3 Suet. Tib. 70.

It may be urged in defence ospoena‚ that it is the punishment
of Tityus' lust which is generally brought into relief when his
story is mentioned. So Lucretius iii. 990, 1 Non tamen aeternum
poterit perferre dolorem Nec praebere cibum proprio de corpore
semper; Verg. Aen. vi. 598 secundaque poenis Viscera3 Prop.
ii. 20. 31 Atque inter uolucres Tityi mea poena uagelum Ov.
Pont. i. 2. 38-40 Et grauior longa fit mea poena mora. Sic τή-
consumptum Tityi semperque renascens lVon perit, utpossz‘l saepe
perire, iecur. With this foedum is constructed ‘ghastly with
his punishment‚⁷ in reference to the hideous sight of the vultures
tearing and devouring his liver incessantly; cf. Stat. Theb.
xi. 13 zpsae horrent si quando pectore ab allo Emergunt
uolucres, inmensaque membra iacentis Spectant dum miserae
crescunt in pabula fibrae.

in iugera can hardly mean, as Sudhaus suggests, ‘over whole -
acres of ground' in opposition to an implied smaller space;
nor even over the acres of ground described by the poets
from Homer onwards, and become familiar through thern.
In this case we should look for in sua iugera: but either
view is unsatisfactory.

In 81 1 have little doubt that circum of MSS. is right. Le
Clerc cites the description in Od. xi. 582—592‚ where the waters
and fruits are all about Tantalus, but never near enough to be
grasped3 and Tib. i. 3. 77 Tantalus est illic et circum stagna,
sed acrem lam iam poturi deserit unda sitim: similarly Baehrens'

note on Col. v. 1. Hence 9 plethra = 14‚400 seet><9 = 129‚600;
5 iugers =28,800 >< 5 = 144‚000. Thus (roughly) 130,ooo seet(9 plethra
or half-iugers) would be not sar from 144‚000 (roughly 1405000) or
5 iugers.

¹ septem looks like a reminiscence of Il. xxi. 407 ἑπτὰ δ’ ἐπέσχε
πέλεθρα πεσών, said os Ares.
