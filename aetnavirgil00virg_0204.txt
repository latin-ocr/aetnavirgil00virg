AETNA

it must be nominative, but this will hardly satisfy. Unger's
suggestion that fluuium is an error for fluidum is in itself
plausible, as fluidus is usually written in MSS.fluzcz'dus, and
fluus'dum might drop its a’, becomingfltcuz'um. But this almost
requires, as Unger suggested, Hospitium in fluidum, and aut
would still need alteration. fluuium as genitive plural occurs
twice in Val. Flaccus, Arg. vi. 391, 443 fluuiumque uias, and
may be right here: it may also be a corruption, perhaps of
fluuio (the terminations -0‚ -um are often interchanged), or of
fluuio z'am3 among the corrections of aut Baehrens’ det seems
to me the best, Hospitium fluuio det semita, or H. fluuio
iam ac smila: ‘ did not Earth throw out channels at intervals,
serving at the outset (iam) as a receptacle and course for the
river-waters, springs and streams would assuredly lack their
proper bed?

In 131 Conserta, ‘locked together,' i. e. with all its particles
linked into solid cohesion, is possible3 but conserta ‘packed
close,’ has the support of 157 Pigraque et in pondus confi’rla
immobilis esset, which looks like an exact duplicate of 131.

132‚133

Quod s1' praecipiti conduntur flumina terra,
Condita si redeunt, si qua etiam incondita surgunt. C.

The reading of 133 is very uncertain. Siqua el iam (Scaliger),
si qua ante (Μὰ), si quondam (Bormans), sz' quaedam ( Munro),
si quae clam cmzdila smpzmt (Unger), have been suggested.
Munro's si quaedam seems to me the simplest and clearest;
et iam for eliam is questionable. But there is some difficulty
in incondita which with condita preceding can hardly mean
‘out of order, irregular’ (Jacob), and can on1y=‘unburied.’
Birt quotes Sen. controv. vii. Praef. 7 iura per patris cineres
qui inconditi sunt, and so Luc. vi. 101. The meaning seems to
be that some rivers ‘ subito in sua magnitudine existunt, neque
umquam absorpti fuerunt⁷ (Scaliger), rise 01· spring to light
without any previous burial (Munro). The argument: if water
finds channels for itself, sometimes throughout in open light,
sometimes buried for a time and then re-emerging‚ we may
infer that air and wind similarly find their own vent, however
little we may be able to observe it.
