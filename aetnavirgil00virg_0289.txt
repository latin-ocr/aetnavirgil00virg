COMMENTARY

is the northernmost, Vulcano the southernrnost ; between
Strornboli and Vulcano, in an almost straight line from N. to S„
are panaria, then Lipari. Thucydides, iii. 88, after men—
tioning Lipara, Didyme, Strongyle, Hiera, adds: νομίζουσι δέ οἱ
ἐκείνῃ ἅνθρωποι ἐν τῇ Ἰέρᾳ ὡς ὁ ”Ηφαιστ·ος χαλκεύει, ὅτι τὴν νύκτα
φαίνεται πῦρ ἀναδιδοῦσα πολὺ καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν καπνόν. Strab. 275 ταύ-
της (Lipara) δέ μεταξύ πώς ἔστι καὶ τῆς Σικελίας ἣν νῦν Ἱερὰν εΗφαίστου
καλοῦσι, πετρώδης πᾶσα καὶ ἕρημος καὶ διάπυρος. ἔχει δέ ἀναπνοὰς
τρεῖς ὡς ἐκ τριῶν κρατήρων. Scymn. 255 ὧν ἐστὶν Ἱερὰ λεγομένη τις
εὐλόγως, Καιόμενα φαίνεται γὰρ ἐξ αὐτῆς πυρὰ Ἀπὸ σταδίων εὔδηλα
πᾶσι πλειόνων Καὶ διαπύρων εἷς ὕψος ἀναβολαὶ μύδρων Ἐργά τε
σιδήρεός τε ῥαιστήρων κτύπος. Aristot. Meteor. ii. 8. 15 ἐν ταύτῃ (ἱερᾷ
Νήσῳ) ἐξανῴδει τι τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀνῄει οἷον λοφὼδης ὄγκος μετὰ ψόφου.
τέλος δέ ῥαγέντος ἐξῆλθε πνεῦμα πολύ, καὶ τὸν φέψαλον καὶ τὴν
τέφραν ἀνῆκε, καὶ τήν τε Λιπαραίων πόλιν οὖσαν οὐ πόρρω πᾶσαν
κατετέφρωσε καὶ εἷς ε’νὶας τῶν ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ πόλεων ἦλθεν· καὶ νῦν ἔτι
ὅπου τὸ ἀναφύσημα τοῦτο ἐγένετο δῆλόν ἐστι. The words of the
poet, Vulcani nomine sacra, point, 1 think, to the combination
Ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου, mentioned both by Strabo and Diodorus, v. 7.

439 tamen is in reference to its association with Vulcan, which
might seem to imply that it was ever burning.

incendi, genitive, as in Lucr. vi. 673.

441 Quae restat, the part that has not cooled and is still
burning.

minor et diues satis ubere terra est ‘is smaller than the other
part, and is a soil fairly rich in productiveness of material.'
Some think the poet alludes here to the little islet called
Vulcanell0‚ described by Daubeny, p. 260, as ‘ an isolated rock,
which, though without a crater, emits from its crevices vapours
ofa sulphureous nature, a feeble temnant of the volcanic action
by which it was formerly itself thrown up from the bosom of the
sea.’ This rock seems to date from about 200 13.C.‚ and to be
that mentioned by Aristotle περὶ Μετεώρων, ii. ὃ (Daubeny).

442 The MS. reading of this verse,

Sed non Aethnei uires quae conferat illi0

is haffling‚ and eludes certain emendation. If we accept quae
as genuine, the easiest change is Aetnaeo, i.e. sed non quae
conferat uires Aetnaeo illi, ‘ but not such as to match its strength
