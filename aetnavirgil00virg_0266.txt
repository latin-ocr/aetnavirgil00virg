AETNA

quent m Cicero. Cf. Mayor on de Nat. Deor. iii. 17. 433 and
so in Lucr. In my emendation, astantes, sc. auras, means the
draughts of air within the mountain which are waiting ready
to be acted upon by the sudden gust (leuis aura) that is to set
thern in motion.

350 Sparsa liquore manus, Scal. quotes Claud. vi. Cons.
Honorii 324 Lustralem tum rite facem, cui lumen odorum
&aljan-e caeruleo nigroque bitumine fumat, Circum membra
rotat doctus purganda sacerdos Rore pio spargens, in which,
however, the water is sprinkled by the priest on the limbs he
is to purify, not on his own hand as in the verse of Aetna.

351 tamen, though naturally a lighted torch could not be in
meh near contact with the human face without hurting.

pulsata, Ι do not understand: in Postgate’s C. P. L. 3. p. 72
Ι conj. frustrata, ‘ baffied,’ i.e. without producing their natural
effect: quassata might also be suggested. corpora, Plat. Tim.
56 δύο πυρὸς σώματα. nostris brings into curious antithesis the
human body and the bodies of matter.

352 lncursant, charge, without hurting‚ owing to the velocity
with which the torch is whirled round. adeo in tenui uim
causa repellit=adeo in tenui causa est quae uim repellit, ‘in so
small a matter lies the cause of this repulsion of force ’; namely
in the sprinkling of water on the hand, and the rapidity with
which the hand whirls round the lustrating fire: two things
slight in themselves, but enough to allow the human body
(nostris) to feel the impact and charge of these natural bodies
or substances unharmed (sourn. cffPlzilol. 1887, p. 303).

353-356

Non cinerem stipulamue leuem non arida sorbet
Gramina non tenuis plantis humus excita predas
Surgit adoratis sublimis fumus ab aris

Tanta quies illi est et pax innoxia rapti. C.

The whole cast of these vv. points in one direction‚ i.e. to
their continuing the description of the at times undisturbed
condition of the atmosphere on the summit of Aetna ¹. The

¹ Haupt transposed 355, 356 to follow 341, thus explainingfumus
in 355 of the incense offered at the crater, and so sar agreeing with
my view.
