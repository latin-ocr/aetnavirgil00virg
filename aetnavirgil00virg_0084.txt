PROLEGOMENA

shows <Studia in Aetnam Collata, p. 98) that Lucretius
twice combines unde repente vi. 667, 1090. In agreement
with this we find in Aetn. 280 unde repente quies, for so it
is written in C. Gyr. as reported by I and Laur. 33. 9 give
unde reperta quies, which looks like a bad correction and
is undoubtedly wrong.

A second case is 2 59. There the poet speaking of man’s
restless activity, describes him as torturing the earth with
f1re and iron tools to wring from it its secret, Torquentur
flamma terrae ferroque domantur 3 so C. Gyr. gave T or-
rentur a commonplace word, which has no special force
(Alzinger, Der [Veri des Cod. Gyrald. p. 858).

A third case is 222. It is in a passage modelled on
Geor. iv. 6 In temti labor, at tenuis non gloria.

ι Aeln. 221 inmensus labor est sed fertilis idem.
Digna laborantis respondent praemia curis.

Gyr. had Pzgra laboratis. We need no reference to
Vergilian parallels (Alz. quotes Aen. ix. 252 Quae uobis
quae mgna, uiri, pro laudibus istis Praemia posse rear
solum) to prove the superiority of C : dzgna praemia and
laborantis curis correspond and harmonize: in Gyr. not
only is Plgra in opposition to the poet’s aim, which is to
prove that if the task is vast, it has its adequale reward, but
laboratis curis is artificial and belongs to the later latinity of
Val. Flaccus and Statius.

It would seem from this investigation that the a priori
suspicions attaching to the Gyraldinian variants are rein-
forced by an examination of the variants themselves. Some
few of them are indubitably wrong: others are barely, if at
all, intelligible ; a large number must have been wrongly or
imperfectly reported3 a still larger number are of the kind
