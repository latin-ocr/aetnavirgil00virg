235—238

Nubila cur caelo terris denuntiet imbres

Quo rubeat Phoebe quo frater palleat igni
Tempora cur uarient anni primaque iuuenta
Cura aestate perit cura aestas ipsa senescit. C.

235 Cur panope caelo Gyn, whence Matthiae conj. Phatne,
Unger Phaeo, A lsz‘nger Pleias.

237 uer prima iuuenta Gyr. Perhaps prima iuuentae, like
Lucrelius' prima uirorum, i. 85. I thought 1 could trace e, not
a, at the end of iuuenle in S (soum. (gf Philol. for 1895,
p.8l

235, 236 Munro translates, ‘ Why, when Phoebe’s fire is ruddy‚
her brother's pale, this portends clouds for heaven, rains sor
earth,' against the natural construction of the subjunctives
rubeat, palleus, as questions. lf CS rightly give the v., the
nominative to denuntiet is Phoebe. Aratus in the Diosemeia
recounts the different aspects of the moon (46-86) and sun
(87 sqq.) as prognosticating weather. Nubila caelo answers to
terris imbres, clouds expressing for sky what rains express
sor earth, Storm. Dios. 53 παχὶων δέ καὶ ἀμβλείῃσι κεραίαις
Τέτρατον ἐκ τριτάτοιο φόως ἀμενηνὸν ἔχουσα 'He‘ νότῳ ἀμβλύνετ’ ἣ
ὕδατος ἐγγὺς ἐόντος, which E. Poste translates ‘ill-defined with
blunted horns On the third and fourth nights, and shining with
wan beams, The south wind blunts her (the rnoon) or the coming
rain.' And again, 64-66 quoted on 236.

Panope of Gyr. was considered by Munro ‘a gross and palp-
able interpolation'; for why should a divinity associated with
fine calm weather (G. i. 435—7) be introduced in ref. to slorm?
And how can Panope be cloudy (nubila adj.)? Matthiae saw
this and conj. Phatne, the Manger, a constellation which Aratus
includes particularly in his signs of storm. Dios. 160 sqq.‚
specially 170 οὐκ ὀλίγῳ χειμῶνι τότε κλύζονται ι’ίρουραιῑ cf. 172
Haupt accepts this. Unger’s Plzaeo is not far from caelo, and
would be in place, as the name of one of the Hyades (ὕειν)
in llefflod (Schoh Arae 172ss Ilyghnm (P.2a.it 21ss SchoL
Germanic. Arat. p. 75 Breysig.

236 rubeat may refer to the red circle round the moon
mentioned by Aratus, Dios. 64—66, as a sign of storm: αὐτὰρ
