AETNA

of the volcano was meant as a relies to the labouring materials
in its womb.

lt is some support of this hypothesis that Vat. 3272 gives ut
ne (sic).

CS cannot be right in giving quin in 196, sor quis in 197
would naturally require a corresponding pronoun; the doubt
is whether quid (Gyr.) or quis is to be preferred. Torqueat
in any case outweighs torreal3 all MSS. give Aetna, not
Aetnam. This would necessitate quid, ‘it is not a matter
of doubt, what it is that Aetna hurls up (cf. 3 quid raucos
torqueat aestus) (sc. rocks, stones‚ sand), or what is the
marvellous artificer that controls a craft so mighty,’ sc.
spiritus. The two clauses quid—quis will then be opposed to
each other, the materials of the eruption to the motor-force
which controls them. 1f Aetnam is preferred, quid (quis) lor-
queat Aetnam will be little more than a different way of stating
Aut quis m. faber imperet: both mean, what is the active force
within the volcano which causes its upheaval. torqueat must
then mean ‘torture‚' ‘cause to writhe‚’ as in 259 Torquenlur
flamma terrae, where see Alzinger.

F ew will hesitate here. Both exhaustae and glomeratim look
like emendations, the latter, as Alzinger shows from Georges'
Lexicon, a word of late Latin : exhaustae, ⁴ drawn up ' from the
interior of the volcano, is far less significant in a description of
this kind than exustae, ‘burning sand being a marked feature
in an eruption‚’ Munro, who cites aster Lindenbruch Plin. ii.
