COMMENTARY

Gemblacensis‚ for exustas 3 iv. 531 exutus ¹ (or exsulas) Phoebeis
zjgm'bus zjgm's MSS. for exustus. Though glomeratur, glomeran-
tur are not likely to be an error for glomeratim, it is uncertain
what the word was. The r is stubbornly constant in CSRehd.v‚
hence I suggested (Journ. of th'lol. u. s.) glomerator, with which
harenae would partly be constructed ; the *word‚ however, is not
found. Heinsius on Claud. R. P. i. 163 quotes the passage as
in Scal. exustae glomeratus, but with no remark.¹ Luc. vi. 296
has glomerato puluere. [In my text Ι have preferred glomeran-
ler‚ like the Lucretian moderanter, praeproperanter]
202-206
Ipse procul magnos miratur Iuppiter ignes
Neue sepulta noui surgant in bella gigantes
Neu ditem regni pudeat neu tartara caelo
Vertant inocculto tantum premit omnia dextra
Congeries operis saxorum et putris harena. C.
205 Vertat Ar. tremit Gyr.: clam tum tremit Wzgler:
iam turn tremit Schenkl: tacitus tremit Baehrens: totus
tremit Alzz'nger: tantum fremit Damste', ‘non audet quid

metuat proloqui, occulto secum murmurat.' omniaque extra
Gyr.‚ perhaps omnia at extra (J. th'lol. 1887, p. 300) in
occulto: tantum tremit (sc. Aetna) Sudhaus 206 operit Ald.
1517.

If MSS. are right in premit, the words most naturally mean
‘Jupiter keeps the fires down and only working in secret‚'
i. e. keeps the volcanic forces as much to the inside of the
mountain as he can; outside their effects are permanently
visible in boulders and sand. This, however, after the de-
tailed description in 198-201 of burning masses of rock heaved
into the air, thunder-like detonations‚ and livid flames, is all
but impossible: the contrast of in occulto with the visible
and tremendous phenomena of eruption would be too pro-
nounced. Most edd. accept tremit, a word often confused with
premit, e. g. Val. Fl. iv. 129: of the combinations recorded
Baehrens’ is perhaps the nearest to what the poet might be
