COMMENTARY

cena forpoena is simple and good, corresponding to siti in 83,
Luc. Tim. 18 ὥσπερ ὁ Τάνταλος ἄποτοι καὶ ἄγευστοι. ⁷

84 Quicquid et interius falsi sibi conscia terrent. CS.

sibi conscia CSv: consortia Rehd. Arund. terrent CSr:
terra v.

The older correctors changed terrent to terra est, and this
is perhaps the simplest ⁴vieW, if we suppose Quidquid salsi
interius to depend on conscia, ‘as well as every inner lie whereof
Earth is conscious.’ So Fronto, p. 235, Naber, quae mihi conscius
sum protestabor. Then cf. the Plautine gnaruris uos uolo esse
hanc rem Most. i. 2. 17, where Sonnenschein quotes from an
epigram of Pacuvius (A. Geli. i. 24) lzoc uolebam nescius ne esses.
But such a construction is hardly probable in the Latin of Aetna.

Munro thought a verse had fallen out beginning perhaps with
Pectora; he changed terrent to terret: this is also the view
of Buecheler. But if the breasts are conscious of salsehood,
why should they be alarmed? It would be their conviction
of the trutlz of such stories which would srighten them.

The variant found in Reled. consortia may well be right.
Velleius has consors uitiorum, Ovid c. culpae: consortium fizlsz'
would naturally enough express a partnership in falsification or
forgery: terrent 1 change to adhaerent. XVhether interius
or insernist be read, the sense is the same: ‘whatever is
done in the bowels of the earth (or, whatever is part of the
world below), some association of salsehood clings to it‚’ i. e. is
inseparable from it.

96 Non totum et solido desunt namque omnis hiatu

Secta est omnis humus. CS.

solidum Rehd. desinit Helmst. and v : defit Sloan. 777 and
some other MSS. of lalefifleerttlz cent. hiatus Relzd.

et solido must be, I think, ex solido : see my Noctes Manilianae
p. 4. For desunt Vollmer has suggested densum est ¹, Birt den-
sum, with the same meaning. But namque omnis hiatu Secta
est omnis humus is all but impossible : the double omnis requires
a verb in both clauses, and the effect, if such verb is absent, is over-
strained and almost ridiculous. The fifteenth century correction

¹ Reading Non totum et solido densum est.
