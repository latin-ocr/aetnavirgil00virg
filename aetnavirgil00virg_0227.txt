COMMENTARY

not in accord with each other. This might easily be cohibentur
with the abbreviation of -ur omitted. cohibetur of C indeed
is possible, as a suitable nominative may be found in res (219) ;
but cohibentur, whether referred to uenti or incendia, is easier,
and is accepted by Haupt, Munro and Sudhaus, The question
between inest of C and iners of Gyr. is more difficult: iners,
whether a good conjecture, or a real ancient ν. 1., is quite in the
manner of Vergil (with whom our poet has much in common),
transferring, as„ it does, the quiescence (inertia) of the winds or
flames to the cause which produced it. As, however, it cannot
have been read by Heinsius, who gives the v. as Cur subito
cohibent uires, quae causa silendi, I feel less confidence in its
antiquity, and with some hesitation retain inest, as before me
Alzinger.

221 has some resemblance to Verg. G. iv. 6 ln tenui labor,
at lenuis non gloria, but the lofty tone which our poet assumes
in the fine digression, 223 sqq„ proves that to him Science was
no res tenuis but the supreme aspiration of the human intellect-

222. The variants reported from Gyr. of this v.‚ Plgra for
Dzssgna and laboratis for laborantis, are not supported by the
Paris and Escorial excerpts, and are certainly wrong. If they
were in Gyr. they detract from its authority: but they have
the look of modern conjectures. ngno praemia, as in Aen.
ix. 252 (Alzinger) and Ov. Trist. iii. 11. 50, an adequate reward:
laborantis respondent curis responds to, compensates the
labourer's pains. laboratis (Gyr.) was also a conjecture of
Scaliger's, who has not explained his meaning, but no doubt
had in mind Val. Fl. v. 225 Fata laborati Phrixus com·
plenerat aeui (where Langen explains ‘per labores peracti ⁹),
Stat. T. i. 339-341 iam Somnus amaris Inserpit curis pronusque
per aera nutat Grata laboratae referens obliuia uitae. In
both instances the usage belongs to the later and more arti-
ficial Latin of the latter part of the first century, and is alien
from the style of Aetna.

223 sqq. The long series of infinitives beginning with tueri
(223) and ending with disponere (248) depends on diuina est
uoluplas (249), which perhaps determines the dative efficsis
(224), though with W'ernsdorf I have preferred to print efftsos.
