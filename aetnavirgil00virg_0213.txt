COMMENTARY

Augustis opus est turbanti finibus: illo
Feruet opus.

turbanti (dative) opus est angustis saucibus: illo (=illa re)
struet opus, ‘in spreading turrnoil it (uento, got from 165
uentos) must have narrow gullies to work in: this it is which
makes the operation proceed hotly.' The remainder of the
passage can hardly be otherwise than as Gyr. gives it: for
densique of CS, which Sudh. constructs with Euri, is at
best awkward, and it is at any rate safer to retain Gyr.¹s
correction in its totality. WVe can scarcely doubt that a cor·
rection so satisfying in all its parts really comes to us from
antiquity.

Having said thus much in defence of Gyr. here as a whole,
I must confess ἐπέχειν on the first of the three vv. It is a
significant fact that both C and S, as well as Rehd. and v,
preserve an in before saucibus : and in all our MSS. illos ends
the ν.

What is to be made of turbant (CS), turbare (Rehd.v)?
I'alaeography suggests tu7'bc1nte3 then illos might depend on
this, ⁶ there must needs be something that sets them jostling in
narrow grooves.' But turbare is plainer‚ and more idiomatic in
its neuter sense ; opus est illos turbare in f. angustis, ‘those winds
must needs jostle confusedly in narrow passages': a Lucretiam
use, ii. 126 Corpora quae z'n solis radiis turbare amentum v. 502
Nec liquidum corpus turbantibus (‘troubled,’ Mamm) aeris
auris Commiscel: sinit haec m'olentis omnia uerti T τινόίηὶίηις,
sinit incertis turbare (‘to be troubled‚' M.) procellis: and cf.
Conington on Aen. vi. 800. illos is emphasized ‘those winds,’
i.e. that perform such feats of prodigious force, and is therefore
rightly at the end of the ν.
