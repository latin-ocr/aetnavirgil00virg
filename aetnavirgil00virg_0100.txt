ANALYSIS OF THE POEM

(1—8) My song is of Aetna and its subterranean fires. May
Apollo inspire rne for the task.

(9—28) The ancient subjects of poetry are exhausted and
have become over-trite. Mine is a hardier effort, to explain the
causes of Aetna‘s eruptions and of its burning lava-flood.

(29—73) We must not be deluded by the fictions of poetry
about this. Aetna is not Vulcan’s forge, nor the Cyclops’ work-
shop. Such benefis a desecranon ofthe dhune cahn ofthe
gods. Nor is it a record of the conflict between the giants
and the gods: Enceladus is not buried under Aetna, the flames
of the volcano are not the penal fires exhaled from his throat as
he hes hitorture.

(74—93) Such stories are the lies of poets‚ comparable with
their fabled Tartarus, and its punishments of Tityos, Tantalus,
and Ixion. Poetry even invades heaven ;itis acquainted nuth
all the gods do, every detail of Jupiter‘s amours. Such lies are
not for me : my only aspiration is the attainment of truth.

(94-143) The earth is not a solid whole, it is hollow beneath
and filled with cracks and chasms, through which air is passing
centhiuassy‚just as knood passes through the veins of a deng
creature. Like a heap of stones formed by casual accretion, it
