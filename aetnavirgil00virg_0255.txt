310 nebulas effundere, sc. animas. Baehrens' conjecture se
effundere is a elever amalgam of the last letter of nebulas, the
first of effundere.

311 solent, sc. nebulae. adluit Haupt, sor abluit, no doubt
rightly. Nettleship‚ Contributions to Latin Lexz‘cograjzhy, s. v.
cites Varr. R. R. iii. 14. 2 adluant quorum radices lacus ac
fluuii.

312 caligat. Seneca in a very similar passage, where however
he is trying to show that wind is distinct from cloud and mist,
N. Q. v. 3. 2 (quoted by Le Clerc) uses nearly the same
language: Adice nunc quod circa flumina et lacus frequens
nebula est artatis congestisque corporibus, neque tamen uentus
est. interdum uero multa calzgo efftnditur, ut conspectum in
uicino stantium eripiat.

313 Or again water-ducts convey draughts of air, which
nearly amount to wind: the conciseness of the poet makes his
language obscure. Flumina parua is explained by Munro of
the riui taken from the amnis and distributed for irrigation
over the fields. It is not, Ι think, certain that he still has in
view the amnis of 311 ε he seems to be speaking more generally
of any small channel of water. uis, i.e. harum aurarum, ‘currents
of air from water’ (Munro).

314 Eminus adspirat fortis et uerberat humor. C.

[fotis v: perhaps fontis]

Munro explains: ‘humor adspirat fortes auras et uerberibus
impellit, thus increasing their force3 Aen. ν. 607 uentosque
adspirat eunti! In this fortis seems to me too vague: it
suggests rather than supplies the object ineant, namely auras.

By reading sontis a direct object accusative is obtained for
adspirat, ‘moisture from a distance blows jets of water (on
the air-currents) and works them (the aurae) into violence.'
fontis are the several springs or sources from which the
moisture is discharged.

[It does not seem possible to make adspirat sortis = adspirat
in eas et sortis facit, for (1) such a construction of adspirare is
