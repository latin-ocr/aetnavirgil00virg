THE DATE OF ‘AETNA'

the Vergilian age. The tradition, observe‚ comes in two
distinct forms, (1) a Culex is included in two ancient lists
of opuscula ascribed to V ergi13 (2) a Culex by Vergil was
read and admired seventy years after his death by Lucan,
then quite young.

We have then an a priori ground for believing that
Aetna, like the Culex and other minor poems of the
Appendix Vergiliana, belongs to the earlier period of
Roman literature, and can hardly be much later than the
middle of the first century A. D. Who was its author had
begun to be asked as far back as the thirteenth century.
Vincent of Beauvais († 1264) called both the Culex and
Aetna apocryphal (spec. ffi'st. vii. 62) and cites (xx. 2 5)
0 maxima rerum pietas hominum tutzksima uirtus (Aetn. 6 31)
as from Petronius, in which he is followed by Jacobus
Magni († in the second decade of the fifteenth century),
sopholog. iv. 10 (Wernsd. p. 58 3 Bucheler‚ Petronius, p. 227).
In a commentary on Cato's distichs‚ published in 1492
(Bodl. S. Selden, d. 16, fol. 191b) vv. 74-84 are quoted
and thus prefaced: Virgilius aut quisquis autor est iu
carmine de Aethncz'. In some MSS. of the fifteenth or
early sixteenth century it is already ascribed to Cornelius
Severus ², the writer of a lost hexameter poem on the war
with Sex. Pompeius in Sicily (Teuffel 247. 5), of whose
style we have a favourable specimen in twenty-five hexa-
meters on the death of Cicero, preserved by the elder
Seneca (Suas. vi. 26, Burs). The choice of Corn. Severus
was determined‚ as Scaliger points out, by a passage in

¹ Lilius Gyraldus (Historiae Poetarum, iv. p. 572, ed. 1545) says lie
will not venture either to assert or deny its genuineness as a work of
Vergil.
² So in Vat. 3272 and Munro’s ζ.
